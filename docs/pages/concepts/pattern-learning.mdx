# Pattern Learning

agentful agents can learn from every session and compound knowledge over time using the optional MCP server.

## The Compound Engineering Loop

Inspired by Compound Engineering methodology (Plan → Work → Assess → **Compound**), agentful's agents follow this loop:

1. **Plan** - Orchestrator reads product spec, picks next feature
2. **Work** - Specialist agents implement, test, and validate
3. **Assess** - Reviewer runs quality gates, fixer resolves issues
4. **Compound** - Store successful patterns and learnings for reuse

Without the MCP server, agents start from scratch every session. With it, they build on past successes.

## Setup

### Option 1: CLI (Recommended)

Run this once in your project directory to enable pattern learning:

```bash
claude mcp add agentful -- npx -y @itz4blitz/agentful-mcp-server
```

This adds the MCP server at **project scope** (stored in `.claude/settings.local.json`). Restart Claude Code and agents will automatically use the MCP tools when available.

To add it globally (available in all projects):

```bash
claude mcp add -s user agentful -- npx -y @itz4blitz/agentful-mcp-server
```

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

Add the MCP server directly to your Claude Code settings file.

**Project scope** — edit `.claude/settings.json` (or `.claude/settings.local.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentful": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@itz4blitz/agentful-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**User scope** — edit `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentful": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@itz4blitz/agentful-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code after editing.

### Verify It's Working

After setup, run:

```bash
claude mcp list
```

You should see `agentful` in the output. When you start a Claude Code session, the MCP tools (`store_pattern`, `find_patterns`, `add_feedback`) will be available to agents automatically.

## How Agents Use It

### Reviewer → Stores Error Patterns

After running quality gates, the reviewer stores error patterns to MCP so the fixer can look them up later:

```
# After validation fails
store_pattern:
  code: <error pattern and context>
  tech_stack: <detected stack>
  error: <specific error message>
```

### Fixer → Queries Known Fixes

Before attempting manual repairs, the fixer checks if a known fix exists:

```
# Before fixing
find_patterns:
  query: <exact error message>
  tech_stack: <detected stack>
  limit: 3

# After fixing
store_pattern:
  code: <fix that worked>
  error: <error that was fixed>

# After applying a known fix
add_feedback:
  pattern_id: <id from find_patterns>
  success: true/false
```

Patterns with `success_rate > 0.7` are preferred. The feedback loop improves accuracy over time.

### Orchestrator → Stores Implementation Patterns

After a feature passes all quality gates, the orchestrator stores the successful implementation pattern and writes a retrospective:

```
# Store to MCP
store_pattern:
  code: <key implementation pattern>
  tech_stack: <detected stack>

# Append to .agentful/learnings.json
{
  "feature": "user-authentication",
  "review_fix_cycles": 2,
  "gates_failed_initially": ["coverage", "lint"],
  "key_learning": "Auth middleware needed test mocks for JWT verification"
}
```

## Graceful Degradation

All MCP interactions use the pattern:

```
Try MCP tool: X
If unavailable: skip silently
```

The MCP server is **optional**. When not configured:
- MCP tools don't appear in agent tool lists
- Agents skip MCP steps and work normally
- No errors, no warnings, no degradation in core functionality

## State Files

Pattern learning creates these additional state files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `.agentful/learnings.json` | Compound engineering retrospectives per feature |
| `.agentful/last-validation.json` | Latest validation report from reviewer |

Both are gitignored (inside `.agentful/`) and managed automatically.
