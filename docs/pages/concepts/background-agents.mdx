# Parallel Agent Execution

agentful runs multiple agents in parallel by auto-enabling Claude Code's TeammateTool, reducing build time by 3-5x.

## How It Works

On first run, agentful automatically:

1. Detects Claude Code installation
2. Patches TeammateTool gate function (creates backup)
3. Enables parallel agent execution

**You don't need to do anything** - it just works.

```javascript
// Orchestrator spawns 3 agents simultaneously
Task("backend", "Implement auth API");
Task("frontend", "Create login UI");
Task("tester", "Write tests");

// All 3 run at the same time
```

## Example: Building Auth Feature

<Timeline />

**Result:** Parallel is **2.5x faster** (6 min vs 15 min)

## Task Independence

Tasks must be independent to run in parallel:

✅ **Safe:**
```javascript
Task("backend", "src/api/auth.ts");
Task("frontend", "src/pages/Login.tsx");
// Different files, no conflicts
```

❌ **Unsafe:**
```javascript
Task("backend", "Implement auth API");
Task("frontend", "Use auth API"); // Needs backend first!
```

## Manual Control

Check status:
```bash
node lib/parallel-execution.js capabilities
```

Force enable:
```bash
node lib/parallel-execution.js enable
```
