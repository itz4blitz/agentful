# Research Skill

Enables agents to research current best practices, design patterns, and implementation approaches for technologies and product domains.

## What It Provides

**Research Methods**
- Context7 MCP integration patterns (preferred)
- WebSearch fallback strategies
- Query formulation techniques
- Result synthesis methods

**Research Workflows**
- Tech stack analysis procedures
- Domain pattern research
- Pre-implementation research
- Trend analysis approaches

**Quality Criteria**
- Result evaluation standards (recency, authority, specificity)
- Source prioritization rules
- Actionability assessment

## Used By

**`/agentful-generate` Command:**
- Researches best practices for detected tech stack
- Informs domain agent generation
- Guides skill creation with current patterns

**Orchestrator Agent:**
- Before implementing complex features
- When architectural decisions needed
- For comparing implementation approaches

**Agent Generation:**
- Researching framework-specific patterns
- Understanding domain implementation approaches
- Informing specialized agent creation

## Tools Available

- Context7 MCP (if connected)
- WebSearch (always available)
- Read (tech stack detection, product specs)
- Write (research synthesis reports)

## Research Methods

### 1. Context7 MCP (Preferred)

**Note:** Context7 is an **optional** MCP dependency. If not installed, the skill falls back to WebSearch.

**Advantages:**
- Curated, accurate results
- Up-to-date framework documentation
- Language-specific patterns
- Faster than web search
- No noise or outdated content

**Check Availability:**
```javascript
function hasContext7() {
  return typeof mcp__context7__search !== 'undefined';
}
```

**Usage:**
```javascript
const results = await mcp__context7__search({
  query: 'Next.js 15 app router best practices',
  limit: 5
});
```

### 2. WebSearch (Fallback)

**Advantages:**
- Always available
- Broader coverage (blogs, forums)
- Real-world examples
- Community insights

**Limitations:**
- May include outdated content
- Requires filtering and verification
- More noise

**Usage:**
```javascript
const results = await WebSearch({
  query: 'Next.js 15 app router best practices 2026',
  limit: 5
});
// Always include current year for freshness
```

## Research Workflow

### Step 1: Determine Research Method
```javascript
const researchMethod = hasContext7() ? 'context7' : 'websearch';
console.log(`Research method: ${researchMethod}`);
```

### Step 2: Formulate Queries

**Good queries:**
- "Next.js 15 server components best practices"
- "React 19 concurrent rendering patterns"
- "PostgreSQL connection pooling with Prisma"
- "Authentication implementation patterns 2026"

**Bad queries:**
- "Next.js" (too broad)
- "How to code" (too generic)
- "Best JavaScript framework" (subjective, not actionable)

**Query Template:**
```
[Technology/Framework] + [Specific Topic] + [Year]
```

### Step 3: Execute Research

Research 5-10 targeted queries to balance coverage vs speed.

### Step 4: Synthesize Findings

Extract actionable insights:
- Tech stack patterns
- Domain-specific patterns
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls
- References

## Research Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Tech Stack Research

After tech stack detection, research current best practices:

```
Tech Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Prisma

Queries:
1. "Next.js 15.1.0 best practices"
2. "Next.js project structure patterns"
3. "Prisma with PostgreSQL optimization"
4. "TypeScript configuration for Next.js"

Synthesis:
- Framework patterns for Next.js 15
- Project structure recommendations
- Database optimization approaches
- TypeScript configuration best practices
```

### Use Case 2: Domain Research

Research implementation patterns for product domains:

```
Product: Task management app
Domains: authentication, tasks, collaboration

Queries:
1. "Task management app architecture patterns"
2. "Authentication implementation Next.js"
3. "Task management data model design"
4. "Real-time collaboration implementation"

Synthesis:
- Domain-specific implementation patterns
- Database schema design approaches
- API design recommendations
```

### Use Case 3: Pre-Implementation Research

Before implementing complex features:

```
Feature: Real-time notifications
Technologies: WebSockets, Redis, React

Queries:
1. "WebSocket implementation Next.js"
2. "Redis pub/sub patterns notifications"
3. "React real-time updates best practices"
4. "Scaling WebSocket connections"

Synthesis:
- WebSocket implementation patterns
- Redis pub/sub approaches
- React real-time update strategies
- Scalability considerations
```

## Quality Criteria

When evaluating research findings:

1. **Recency**: Prefer results from current year
2. **Authority**: Official docs > verified blogs > forums
3. **Specificity**: Specific patterns > general advice
4. **Actionability**: Code examples > theory
5. **Relevance**: Exact version match > general version

## Examples

### Tech Stack Research Flow
```
1. Detect tech stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma)
2. Check Context7 availability
3. Research queries:
   - "Next.js 15 best practices"
   - "Next.js project structure"
   - "Prisma patterns"
4. Synthesize findings
5. Apply to agent generation
```

### Domain Research Flow
```
1. Read product requirements
2. Extract domains (auth, tasks, collaboration)
3. Research each domain:
   - "Authentication implementation patterns"
   - "Task management data model"
   - "Real-time collaboration implementation"
4. Synthesize domain-specific patterns
5. Inform domain agent specialization
```

### Architectural Decision Research
```
1. Identify complex feature
2. Research implementation approaches:
   - "Feature X implementation approach A"
   - "Feature X implementation approach B"
3. Present findings to user for decision
4. Proceed with chosen approach
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always check Context7 availability first** - More accurate results
2. **Include year in WebSearch queries** - Ensure freshness
3. **Limit queries to 5-10** - Balance coverage vs speed
4. **Synthesize findings** - Don't just dump raw results
5. **Cache research results** - Avoid redundant queries
6. **Provide references** - Link to source material
7. **Time-box research** - Don't spend hours researching

## Rules

### DO
- Prefer Context7 when available
- Include current year in WebSearch queries
- Formulate specific, targeted queries
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights
- Provide references to sources
- Time-box research activities

### DON'T
- Use overly broad queries
- Skip synthesis step
- Ignore result quality criteria
- Spend excessive time researching
- Present raw results without context
