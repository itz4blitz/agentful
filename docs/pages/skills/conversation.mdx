# Conversation Skill

The **conversation skill** provides natural language understanding, intent classification, and context management for agentful's conversational interface.

## What It Does

When you use `/agentful`, this skill:
- **Classifies your intent** - Determines if you want to add features, fix bugs, check status, etc.
- **Extracts information** - Pulls out feature names, bug descriptions, requirements
- **Manages context** - Remembers previous messages in the conversation
- **Handles ambiguity** - Asks clarifying questions when needed
- **Resolves references** - Understands pronouns like "it", "that", "the feature"

## User Experience

When you invoke the conversation skill, you'll see visual feedback:

```
/agentful Add user authentication

running… /agentful Add user authentication
```

The **"running…"** indicator appears briefly, followed by your full message. This confirms:
- Your input was received ✅
- The conversation skill is processing your request
- agentful is working on understanding your intent

After processing, agentful responds based on the classified intent.

## Intent Classification

The conversation skill recognizes these intents:

| Intent | Trigger | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **FEATURE_REQUEST** | "Add authentication", "Create login" | Delegate to orchestrator |
| **BUGFIX_REQUEST** | "Fix the login bug", "Not working" | Start bugfix workflow |
| **STATUS_QUERY** | "How's it going?", "What's left?" | Show status |
| **VALIDATION_REQUEST** | "Run tests", "Check quality" | Run validation |
| **DECISION_QUERY** | "What needs decisions?" | Show pending decisions |
| **CONTINUE_REQUEST** | "Continue", "Next" | Resume development |
| **PRODUCT_QUERY** | "What are we building?" | Explain product |

## Conversation History

The skill maintains conversation history in `.agentful/conversation-history.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "session_id": "uuid",
  "messages": [
    {
      "user_input": "Add user authentication",
      "classified_intent": "FEATURE_REQUEST",
      "timestamp": "2026-01-19T02:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "context": {
    "last_intent": "FEATURE_REQUEST",
    "conversation_state": "active"
  }
}
```

## Context Management

The conversation skill:

### Maintains Context
- Remembers the last action you took
- Tracks conversation state (new, active, stalled)
- Stores feature references for pronoun resolution

### Handles Context Loss
If you return after a long pause:
```
agentful: Welcome back! While you were gone:
• Completed: User authentication (100%)
• Now working on: User profile feature
• Progress: 45%

Want to continue where we left off?
```

### Resolves References
```
You: /agentful Add authentication
agentful: Starting authentication development...
You: Make it use NextAuth
agentful: [Understands "it" = authentication, switches to NextAuth]
```

## Advanced Features

### Ambiguity Detection
```
You: Add the user thing
agentful: I found multiple user-related features:
• User Authentication
• User Profiles
• User Settings

Which one do you want to add?
```

### Mind Change Handling
```
You: Add authentication
agentful: Starting authentication...
You: Actually, start with profiles first
agentful: [Detects priority change, switches to profiles]
```

### Status Inference
```
You: Is authentication done?
agentful: Let me check... [reads state]
Authentication is complete! ✅ (100%)
```

## Technical Details

**Model:** Sonnet (optimized for language tasks)

**Tools:**
- Read - Read conversation history and state files
- Write - Update conversation history
- Edit - Modify conversation context
- Glob - Find relevant files
- Grep - Search for references

**File Locations:**
- Skill: `.claude/skills/conversation/SKILL.md`
- History: `.agentful/conversation-history.json`
- State: `.agentful/state.json`

## Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development
```
You: /agentful Add user profiles with avatar upload

conversation skill:
→ Intent: FEATURE_REQUEST
→ Feature: "user profiles"
→ Requirements: ["avatar upload"]
→ Context: {"feature": "user profiles", "requirements": ["avatar upload"]}

Orchestrator: Starting user profiles with avatar upload...
```

### Example 2: Bug Fix
```
You: /agentful The login button doesn't work

conversation skill:
→ Intent: BUGFIX_REQUEST
→ Bug: "login button doesn't work"
→ Context: {"bug": "login button", "severity": "high"}

Orchestrator: Investigating login button issue...
```

### Example 3: Status Check
```
You: /agentful How's the authentication feature going?

conversation skill:
→ Intent: STATUS_QUERY
→ Target: "authentication feature"
→ Context: {"query": "authentication status"}

agentful-status: Authentication is 75% complete...
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
✅ **Good:** "Add user authentication with Google OAuth"
❌ **Bad:** "Add auth stuff"

### 2. Use Complete Sentences
✅ **Good:** "I want to add user profile pages with avatar upload"
❌ **Bad:** "Profiles avatar upload"

### 3. Reference Previous Context
✅ **Good:** "Actually, start with profiles instead of authentication"
❌ **Bad:** "Start with profiles" (loses context)

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "agentful doesn't understand me"
**Solution:** Use more specific language. Instead of "fix the thing", say "fix the login button"

### Issue: "agentful forgot what we were talking about"
**Solution:** Long pauses (>30 min) cause context loss. Just summarize: "Continue with authentication"

### Issue: "agentful asks too many questions"
**Solution:** Provide complete requirements upfront: "Add authentication with Google OAuth, session duration 7 days"
