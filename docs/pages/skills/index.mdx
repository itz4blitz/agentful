# Skills

**Skills are knowledge, not actors.** They provide patterns, documentation, and procedures that agents use to perform tasks. Think of skills as technical manuals that agents consult.

## Skills vs Agents

- **Skills** = Knowledge (how to do something)
- **Agents** = Actors (does the work)

Example: The validation skill contains knowledge about running tests, type checking, and linting. The reviewer agent uses this skill to actually validate code.

## Built-in Skills

| Skill | Knowledge Provided | Used By |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **[conversation](/skills/conversation)** | Intent classification, context management patterns | `/agentful` command |
| **[product-tracking](/skills/product-tracking)** | Progress calculation methods, state tracking | `/agentful-status`, orchestrator |
| **[validation](/skills/validation)** | Quality gate checks, tool detection | `/agentful-validate`, reviewer |

## Technology Skills

Technology-specific skills (React, Express, Prisma, etc.) are generated from your codebase using:

```bash
/agentful-generate
```

This analyzes your project and creates skills containing:
- Framework patterns detected in your code
- Tech stack conventions you're using
- Project-specific architectural decisions

These generated skills ensure agents follow your existing patterns instead of imposing generic templates.

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a Markdown file at `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown

model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash

# Skill Name

## Knowledge Provided
What information this skill contains

## Usage Patterns
How agents should use this knowledge

## Examples
Concrete examples of applying this skill
```

## How Agents Use Skills

1. Agent receives a task
2. Agent checks relevant skills for patterns/procedures
3. Agent applies knowledge to execute the task
4. Agent updates state using skill-defined structures

Example flow:
```
User: /agentful add authentication

1. conversation skill → classifies intent as "feature_request"
2. orchestrator agent → reads product-tracking skill for progress tracking
3. backend agent → uses generated Express skill for implementation patterns
4. reviewer agent → applies validation skill to check quality
```

## Custom Skills

Create custom skills in `.claude/skills/`:

```bash
.claude/skills/
├── my-deployment/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── my-monitoring/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Example custom skill:

```markdown
---
name: deployment
description: Deployment procedures for our infrastructure
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Bash
---

# Deployment Skill

## Deployment Targets
- Production: AWS ECS
- Staging: Vercel
- Preview: Netlify

## Pre-deployment Checklist
1. All tests passing
2. Type checking clean
3. Environment variables set
4. Database migrations applied

## Deployment Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Production
npm run deploy:prod

# Staging
npm run deploy:staging
\`\`\`

## Rollback Procedure
\`\`\`bash
npm run rollback -- --version <previous-version>
\`\`\`
```

Agents will reference this skill when deploying your application.

## Next Steps

- **[Conversation Skill](/skills/conversation)** - Intent classification and context management
- **[Product-Tracking Skill](/skills/product-tracking)** - Progress calculation and state tracking
- **[Validation Skill](/skills/validation)** - Quality gate checks and tool detection
- **[Custom Agents](/agents/custom-agents)** - Create agents that use skills
