# Skills

**Skills are knowledge, not actors.** They provide patterns, documentation, and procedures that agents use to perform tasks. Think of skills as technical manuals that agents consult.

## Skills vs Agents

- **Skills** = Knowledge (how to do something)
- **Agents** = Actors (does the work)

Example: The validation skill contains knowledge about running tests, type checking, and linting. The reviewer agent uses this skill to actually validate code.

## Built-in Skills

| Skill | Knowledge Provided | Used By |
|-------|-------------------|---------|
| **[conversation](/skills/conversation)** | Intent classification, context management patterns | `/agentful` command |
| **[deployment](/skills/deployment)** | Deployment procedures, production readiness checks | Orchestrator, deployment workflows |
| **[product-planning](/skills/product-planning)** | Specification analysis, gap identification | `/agentful-product`, product-analyzer |
| **[product-tracking](/skills/product-tracking)** | Progress calculation methods, state tracking | `/agentful-status`, orchestrator |
| **[research](/skills/research)** | Best practices research via Context7/WebSearch | `/agentful-generate`, orchestrator |
| **[testing](/skills/testing)** | Test strategy, coverage optimization | Tester agent, reviewer agent |
| **[validation](/skills/validation)** | Quality gate checks, tool detection | `/agentful-validate`, reviewer |

## Technology Skills

Technology-specific skills (React, Express, Prisma, etc.) are generated from your codebase using:

```bash
/agentful-generate
```

This analyzes your project and creates skills containing:
- Framework patterns detected in your code
- Tech stack conventions you're using
- Project-specific architectural decisions

These generated skills ensure agents follow your existing patterns instead of imposing generic templates.

## Skill Structure

Each skill is a Markdown file at `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: What this skill provides
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash
---

# Skill Name

## Knowledge Provided
What information this skill contains

## Usage Patterns
How agents should use this knowledge

## Examples
Concrete examples of applying this skill
```

## How Agents Use Skills

1. Agent receives a task
2. Agent checks relevant skills for patterns/procedures
3. Agent applies knowledge to execute the task
4. Agent updates state using skill-defined structures

Example flow:
```
User: /agentful add authentication

1. conversation skill → classifies intent as "feature_request"
2. orchestrator agent → reads product-tracking skill for progress tracking
3. backend agent → uses generated Express skill for implementation patterns
4. reviewer agent → applies validation skill to check quality
```

## Custom Skills

Create custom skills in `.claude/skills/`:

```bash
.claude/skills/
├── staging-workflow/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── monitoring/
    └── SKILL.md
```

Example custom skill:

```markdown
---
name: staging-workflow
description: Custom staging deployment workflow for our infrastructure
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Bash
---

# Staging Workflow Skill

## Deployment Targets
- Staging: Vercel Preview
- Pre-production: AWS ECS
- Demo: Netlify

## Pre-deployment Checklist
1. All tests passing
2. Type checking clean
3. Environment variables set
4. Database migrations applied

## Deployment Commands
\`\`\`bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to pre-production
npm run deploy:preprod
\`\`\`

## Rollback Procedure
\`\`\`bash
npm run rollback:staging -- --version <previous-version>
\`\`\`
```

Agents will reference this skill when deploying your application.
