# Product-Planning Skill

Analyzes product specifications for completeness, identifies gaps, and guides refinement to ensure requirements are ready for development.

## What It Provides

**Product Specification Analysis**
- Methods for reading flat and hierarchical product structures
- Patterns for identifying missing requirements
- Techniques for detecting ambiguous language
- Procedures for finding conflicting requirements

**Readiness Scoring**
- Gap severity classification (blocking, warning, recommendation)
- Prioritization patterns for issue resolution
- Quality dimension evaluation methods

**Refinement Guidance**
- Question formulation strategies (5 W's framework)
- Feature breakdown techniques
- Acceptance criteria templates
- Dependency mapping methods

**Structure Validation**
- Domain organization verification
- Feature definition standards
- Priority level validation (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)

## Used By

**`/agentful-product` Command:**
- Primary consumer for product spec analysis
- Generates readiness scores and improvement recommendations
- Identifies gaps before development begins

**Product-Analyzer Agent:**
- Uses this skill for comprehensive spec analysis
- Calculates readiness scores (0-100%)
- Validates tech stack compatibility
- Detects circular dependencies

**Conversation Skill:**
- When user asks "Is my product spec ready?"
- When user uploads or updates product documentation

## Tools Available

- Read (product specs, analysis reports)
- Write (analysis reports, product-analysis.json)
- Edit (product spec improvements)
- Glob (find domain files)
- Grep (search for features, requirements)

## Product Structure Support

### Flat Structure
```
.claude/product/
└── index.md           # All features in one file
```

### Hierarchical Structure
```
.claude/product/
├── index.md           # Overview
└── domains/
    ├── authentication/
    │   └── index.md
    └── profiles/
        └── index.md
```

## Readiness Scoring

**IMPORTANT:** The authoritative readiness scoring formula is defined in `.claude/agents/product-analyzer.md`.

**Ready to Build Criteria:**
- Readiness score ≥ 75%
- Zero blocking issues
- Tech stack 100% specified

**Quality Dimensions:**
- Completeness (features have descriptions, acceptance criteria)
- Clarity (unambiguous requirements, measurable metrics)
- Feasibility (realistic tech choices, achievable scope)
- Testability (verifiable acceptance criteria)
- Consistency (no conflicts, aligned priorities)

**Gap Severity:**
- **BLOCKING**: Cannot proceed without this information
- **WARNING**: Major ambiguity that will cause rework
- **RECOMMENDATION**: Nice-to-have details for better clarity

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Detect Product Structure
```bash
# Check for flat structure
.claude/product/index.md

# Check for hierarchical structure
.claude/product/domains/*/index.md
```

### Step 2: Analyze Completeness

**For each feature, verify:**
1. Description exists and is clear (what, why, who)
2. Acceptance criteria are defined and testable
3. Priority is assigned (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
4. Technical considerations noted (performance, security, scalability)

**For overall product, verify:**
1. Tech stack is specified
2. Goals are clear and measurable
3. Target users are defined
4. Domains are well-organized (hierarchical only)

### Step 3: Delegate to Product Analyzer

For comprehensive analysis including readiness scoring:

```bash
Task("product-analyzer", "Analyze .claude/product/index.md and generate product-analysis.json")
```

The product-analyzer will:
- Calculate readiness score (0-100%)
- Identify blocking issues, warnings, recommendations
- Validate priority levels
- Check tech stack compatibility
- Detect circular dependencies

### Step 4: Generate Report

Save analysis to `.agentful/product-analysis.json`.

### Step 5: Provide Recommendations

Generate specific, actionable recommendations:
- List specific questions to ask the user
- Suggest template improvements
- Recommend splitting/merging features
- Provide examples from similar features

## Priority Level Guidelines

**Standard priority levels** (ONLY these are valid):

- **CRITICAL**: Must-have for MVP, blocking for launch
- **HIGH**: Important for launch, significant value
- **MEDIUM**: Nice-to-have, enhances experience
- **LOW**: Future consideration, not needed for launch

**Invalid priority levels** (flag as BLOCKING issue):
- P0, P1, P2, P3
- Must-have, Should-have, Nice-to-have
- 1, 2, 3, 4
- Any custom values

## Examples

### Feature Request Analysis
```
Feature: User Authentication
Status: Incomplete

Missing:
- OAuth provider support (should we support Google, GitHub?)
- Session timeout duration (security requirement)
- 2FA requirement (compliance consideration)

Questions:
1. Should we support OAuth providers (Google, GitHub)?
2. What's the session timeout requirement?
3. Do we need 2FA for compliance?
```

### Readiness Check
```
Product Specification Analysis

Readiness Score: 68/100

Ready to Build: NO
- Readiness score: 68% (>= 75% required)
- Blocking issues: 3 (0 required)
- Tech stack: 85% complete (100% required)

Blocking Issues (3):
1. **Authentication**: OAuth providers not specified
2. **Database**: Missing database choice
3. **Tech Stack**: Deployment platform not specified
```

### Refinement Guidance
```
Suggestions for "User Profiles" feature:

Current:
> Users can update their profiles

Improved:
> Users can update their profiles with:
> - Display name (required)
> - Avatar image (optional, max 2MB)
> - Bio text (optional, max 500 chars)
>
> Acceptance Criteria:
> - [x] User can update display name
> - [x] User can upload avatar (JPG, PNG)
> - [x] Avatar is resized to 200x200px
> - [x] Bio is limited to 500 characters
> - [x] Changes are saved immediately
```
