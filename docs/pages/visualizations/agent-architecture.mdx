# Agent Architecture Visualization

An interactive network diagram showing how agentful's agents communicate, delegate work, and coordinate development tasks.

## Overview

The Agent Architecture visualization reveals the heart of agentful's autonomous development system: a central **orchestrator** that intelligently delegates work to eight specialized agents, each with unique skills and responsibilities.

This visualization helps you understand:
- How agents communicate with each other
- Which agent handles which types of tasks
- The flow of information through the system
- Dependencies between different development phases

## Interactive Demo

Hover over any agent to see details. Click an agent to view its skills and responsibilities.

## The Eight Core Agents

### 🎯 Orchestrator (Center)

**Role:** Central coordinator that manages all other agents

**Responsibilities:**
- Analyzes product specification and breaks down features
- Delegates tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- Tracks progress across all development phases
- Makes high-level decisions about workflow
- Manages human-in-the-loop checkpoints

**When it works:** Throughout entire development lifecycle

**Delegates to:** All agents based on current phase and task type

---

### 📊 Product Analyzer

**Role:** Analyzes product specifications for completeness and clarity

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse `.claude/product/index.md` and domain specifications
- Detect ambiguities, gaps, and unclear requirements
- Calculate product readiness score (0-100%)
- Generate recommendations for improvement
- Identify missing acceptance criteria

**Skills:**
- Requirements analysis
- Gap detection
- Readiness scoring

**When it works:** Before development begins, and when requirements change

**Reports to:** Orchestrator

---

### 🏗️ Architect

**Role:** Designs system architecture and tech stack

**Responsibilities:**

- Design system architecture and component boundaries
- Generate domain-specific agents for detected patterns
- Establish coding conventions and patterns
- Make technology recommendations

**Skills:**

- Manage client-side state
- Handle forms and validation
- Implement responsive design
- Optimize performance (code splitting, lazy loading)

**Skills:**
- Component development
- State management

### 🧪 Tester

**Role:** Writes comprehensive tests

**Responsibilities:**
- Write unit tests for functions and components
- Write integration tests for APIs and workflows
- Write E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

**Skills:**
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests

**When it works:** After implementation, before quality gates

**Reports to:** Orchestrator

---

### 🔍 Reviewer

**Role:** Validates code quality and runs automated checks

**Responsibilities:**
- Run six automated quality gates
- Review code for patterns and best practices
- Check documentation completeness
- Validate production readiness
- Generate validation reports

**Skills:**
- Quality checks
- Dead code detection
- Production readiness

**Quality Gates:**
1. Type checking (TypeScript/Flow)
2. Linting (ESLint/Prettier)
3. Tests (all passing)
4. Coverage (minimum 80%)
5. Security (no vulnerabilities)
6. Dead code (no unused exports)

**When it works:** Before review and deployment phases

**Reports to:** Orchestrator

---

### 🔧 Fixer

**Role:** Automatically remediates validation failures

**Responsibilities:**
- Fix type errors by adding annotations
- Resolve linting issues (formatting, unused vars)
- Fix failing tests or add missing test cases
- Update vulnerable dependencies
- Remove dead code and unused exports

**Skills:**
- Auto-remediation
- Test fixes
- Type error resolution

**When it works:** When quality gates fail

**Reports to:** Orchestrator (receives failures from Reviewer)

---

## Communication Patterns

### Delegation Flow

The orchestrator uses a hub-and-spoke pattern:

```
Orchestrator → Product Analyzer → Analyze spec
            → Architect → Design system
            → Backend → Implement APIs
            → Frontend → Build UI
            → Tester → Write tests
            → Reviewer → Validate quality
            → Fixer → Fix issues
```

### Information Flow

Agents share information through structured data files:

- **`.agentful/state.json`** - Current phase, progress, blocking issues
- **`.agentful/architecture.json`** - Detected tech stack, generated agents
- **`.agentful/completion.json`** - Feature completion percentages
- **`.agentful/decisions.json`** - Pending and resolved decisions
- **`.agentful/last-validation.json`** - Quality gate results

### Feedback Loops

**Auto-fix Loop:**
```
Reviewer (fails) → Orchestrator → Fixer → Implementation → Reviewer (retry)
```

**Human Checkpoint:**
```
Orchestrator → Decision needed → Pause → Human input → Resume
```

## Customization

### Domain-Specific Agents

The **Architect** agent can generate custom agents for your tech stack:

```typescript
// Example: E-commerce domain agent
{
  name: "ecommerce-specialist",
  role: "Implements shopping cart, checkout, payment integration",
  skills: ["Stripe API", "Cart state", "Order processing"],
  triggers: ["payment", "checkout", "cart", "order"]
}
```

These appear as additional nodes connected to the orchestrator.

### Agent Configuration

Customize agent behavior in `.claude/agents/`:

```markdown
# Modify backend agent
You are the Backend Agent with additional expertise in:
- AWS Lambda deployment
- DynamoDB data modeling
- EventBridge event-driven patterns
```

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Tab** - Navigate between agents
- **Enter / Space** - Open agent details
- **Escape** - Close details panel
- **+** - Zoom in
- **-** - Zoom out
- **0** - Reset zoom
- **Arrow keys** - Pan view

---

## Integration with agentful

### View Current Agent Activity

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Check which agent is working
/agentful-status
```

Output shows:
```
Current Phase: Implementation
Active Agent: backend
Progress: 65%
Working on: User authentication API
```

### View Agent Architecture

```bash
# Generate architecture.json
/agentful-analyze

# View in visualization (web)
open docs/pages/visualizations/agent-architecture.mdx
```

### Monitor Agent Communication

Check `.agentful/state.json` to see orchestrator's current delegation:

```json
{
  "currentPhase": "implementation",
  "activeAgent": "backend",
  "task": "user-auth-api",
  "delegatedAt": "2024-01-21T10:30:00Z",
  "progress": 65
}
```
