# Development Workflow Pipeline

An interactive visualization showing the complete development pipeline from product specification to deployment.

## Overview

The Development Workflow Pipeline demonstrates how agentful manages the entire software development lifecycle through six distinct stages, with automated quality gates and decision points ensuring high-quality output at every step.

## Interactive Example

Click any stage to see detailed breakdown with sub-steps and progress metrics. Use the controls to zoom and pan.

import { DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline } from '../../components/visualizations/DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline.tsx'

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline
    currentStage="implement"
    completedStages={['spec']}
    failedStages={[]}
    interactive={false}
    showControls={false}
    animatedFlow={true}
    orientation="horizontal"
    height="600px"
  />
</div>

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Product Specification 📋
The **Product Analyzer** agent evaluates your product specification for completeness, clarity, and feasibility. It identifies gaps, ambiguities, and calculates a readiness score before development begins.

**Key Activities:**
- Parse and analyze `.claude/product/index.md`
- Detect missing requirements or unclear acceptance criteria
- Calculate product readiness score (0-100%)
- Generate recommendations for improvement

### 2. Implementation ⚙️
The **Architect**, **Backend**, and **Frontend** agents collaborate to build your application based on the specification.

**Key Activities:**
- Architect detects tech stack and designs system architecture
- Backend implements APIs, database schemas, and business logic
- Frontend builds UI components, pages, and client-side interactions
- All agents follow established patterns and conventions

### 3. Testing 🧪
The **Tester** agent writes comprehensive tests covering all code paths and user scenarios.

**Key Activities:**
- Write unit tests for individual functions and components
- Write integration tests for API endpoints and workflows
- Write E2E tests for critical user journeys
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage

### 4. Quality Gates 🔍
The **Reviewer** agent runs automated quality checks. If any check fails, the **Fixer** agent automatically attempts remediation.

**Six Core Quality Gates:**
1. **Type Checking** - No TypeScript/Flow errors
2. **Linting** - Code follows style guide (ESLint/Prettier)
3. **Tests** - All tests passing
4. **Coverage** - Minimum 80% code coverage
5. **Security** - No vulnerable dependencies
6. **Dead Code** - No unused exports or files

**Decision Point:** All checks pass?
- **Yes** → Proceed to Review
- **No** → Auto-fix loop (Fixer agent resolves issues)

### 5. Final Review ✅
The **Reviewer** agent performs final validation before deployment, including manual checks and documentation review.

**Key Activities:**
- Review code quality and architecture decisions
- Verify acceptance criteria met
- Check documentation completeness
- Validate production readiness

**Decision Point:** Approved?
- **Yes** → Proceed to Deploy
- **No** → Return to Implementation

### 6. Deploy 🚀
The **Orchestrator** agent coordinates deployment to staging and production environments.

**Key Activities:**
- Build production optimized bundle
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run smoke tests
- Deploy to production
- Monitor for issues

## Key Features

### Automated Fixer Loop
When quality gates fail, the **Fixer** agent automatically attempts to resolve issues:
- Fix type errors by adding proper type annotations
- Resolve linting issues (formatting, unused variables)
- Fix failing tests or add missing test cases
- Update dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities
- Remove dead code and unused exports

The fixer loop is visualized as a **red dashed edge** from the Quality Gates decision point back to Implementation.

### Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints
While agentful automates most of the development pipeline, it includes strategic human checkpoints:
- **Product Specification:** Review and approve before development
- **Quality Gates:** Review failures that fixer cannot resolve
- **Final Review:** Approve before deployment
- **Deploy Decision:** Confirm production deployment

### Real-time Progress Tracking
Each stage shows:
- **Status badge:** Complete (✓), In Progress (⟳), Pending (○), Failed (✕)
- **Progress bar:** Visual percentage complete
- **Time spent:** Duration agent worked on this stage
- **Sub-steps:** Detailed breakdown of activities

## Examples

### Quality Gate Failure

Here's what happens when quality gates fail:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline
    currentStage="quality"
    completedStages={['spec', 'implement', 'test']}
    failedStages={['quality']}
    height="600px"
  />
</div>

Notice the **failed status** (red ✕) on Quality Gates. The Fixer agent will automatically loop back to Implementation to resolve issues.

### Successful Deployment

Here's a complete successful pipeline run:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline
    currentStage="deploy"
    completedStages={['spec', 'implement', 'test', 'quality', 'review']}
    height="600px"
  />
</div>

All stages show **complete status** (green ✓), and the pipeline is ready for production deployment.

### Vertical Orientation

For narrow layouts, use vertical orientation:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline
    currentStage="test"
    completedStages={['spec', 'implement']}
    orientation="vertical"
    height="1000px"
  />
</div>

## Integration with agentful

The pipeline visualization reflects the actual state tracked in `.agentful/state.json`:

```json
{
  "currentPhase": "implementation",
  "currentStage": "implement",
  "progress": {
    "spec": 100,
    "implement": 65,
    "test": 0,
    "quality": 0,
    "review": 0,
    "deploy": 0
  },
  "lastValidation": {
    "status": "pending",
    "gates": {}
  }
}
```

Run `/agentful-status` to see your current pipeline progress in the CLI.

## Keyboard Shortcuts
