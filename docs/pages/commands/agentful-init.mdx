# /agentful-init

Interactive onboarding wizard that guides you through agentful setup with 7 questions.

## Overview

The `/agentful-init` command provides a guided, interactive setup experience for first-time agentful users. It asks 7 focused questions to understand your project and automatically generates your product specification.

**When to use:**
- First time using agentful
- New project with no product spec
- Want guided setup instead of manual editing

**What it creates:**
- `.claude/product/index.md` - Your product specification
- Auto-triggers `/agentful-generate` to create specialized agents
- `.agentful/setup-progress.json` - Tracks setup state

## Usage

```bash
/agentful-init
```

The command will:
1. Check if already initialized (offers to continue or restart)
2. Auto-detect your tech stack
3. Ask 7 guided questions
4. Generate product specification
5. Automatically generate specialized agents
6. Prepare for `/agentful-start`

## The 7 Questions

### Question 1: Product Description
```
What are you building?

Describe your product in 1-3 sentences:
- What problem does it solve?
- Who is it for?
- What makes it unique?
```

**Example**: "A task management app for remote teams that integrates with Slack and automatically prioritizes work based on deadlines and dependencies."

### Question 2: Tech Stack Confirmation
```
I detected this tech stack:
- Language: TypeScript
- Framework: Next.js 15
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- Testing: Vitest

Is this correct?
```

Options:
- Yes, correct
- No, let me specify manually

### Question 3: Key Features
```
What are the main features you want to build?

List 3-10 key features, one per line.
```

**Example**:
```
User authentication with email/password
Task creation and assignment
Real-time notifications
Calendar integration
Team collaboration spaces
```

### Question 4: Feature Priorities
```
Should I:
- Auto-assign priorities based on typical MVP (recommended)
- Let me set priorities for each feature manually
```

Auto-assignment logic:
- First 30% of features → CRITICAL
- Next 40% → HIGH
- Remaining → MEDIUM

### Question 5: Testing Strategy
```
What level of testing do you want?
- Comprehensive (unit + integration + E2E)
- Standard (unit + integration)
- Minimal (unit tests only)
```

Sets coverage target:
- Comprehensive: 85%
- Standard/Minimal: 80%

### Question 6: Deployment Target
```
Where will this be deployed?
- Vercel
- AWS (EC2, Lambda, etc.)
- Google Cloud
- Docker/Self-hosted
- Not sure yet / Multiple targets
```

Helps optimize build configs and suggest best practices.

### Question 7: Experience Level
```
What's your experience level with [detected framework]?
- Expert - I know the internals
- Proficient - I build with it regularly
- Intermediate - I know the basics
- Beginner - First time using this stack
```

Adjusts verbosity of agent explanations:
- Expert → Concise
- Proficient/Intermediate → Moderate
- Beginner → Detailed

## Generated Product Spec

The command creates `.claude/product/index.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# [Your Product Name]

[Product description from Q1]

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: Next.js 15
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma
- **Testing**: Vitest
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## Features

### 1. User Authentication - CRITICAL
[Auto-generated description based on feature name]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Email/password registration
- [ ] Login with session management
- [ ] Password reset flow
- [ ] Email verification

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Status**: Not started

---

### 2. Task Creation - CRITICAL
...

[Continues for all features]
```

## Resume Support

If interrupted, `/agentful-init` can resume where you left off:

```
Found incomplete setup from 2026-01-25T10:30:00Z.

Completed so far:
✓ Product description
✓ Tech stack
✓ Feature list
✗ Priority assignment

Would you like to:
- Resume where I left off
- Start over from beginning
```

Progress is saved to `.agentful/setup-progress.json`.

## After Completion

Once setup completes, you'll see:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   ✅ Setup Complete!
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Your agentful project is ready for autonomous development.

What was created:
  📄 .claude/product/index.md (8 features)
  🤖 Specialized agents (generated for your domains)
  📚 Tech skills (Next.js, Prisma, etc.)
  ⚙️  Quality gates (tests, linting, security)

Next steps:

1. Review your product spec:
   cat .claude/product/index.md

2. Start development:
   /agentful-start

3. Monitor progress:
   /agentful-status

## vs /agentful-product

| Feature | /agentful-init | /agentful-product |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Best for** | First-time users | Existing projects |
| **Interaction** | 7 guided questions | Auto-detects workflow |
| **Creates spec** | Yes | Yes (if missing) |
| **Analyzes spec** | No | Yes |
| **Refinement mode** | No | Yes |
| **Q&A mode** | No | Yes |
| **Tech detection** | Yes | Yes |

**Recommendation**: Use `/agentful-init` for your first project, then use `/agentful-product` for analysis and refinement.

## Comparison with Other Commands

```bash
# For brand new users
/agentful-init         # Start here - guided setup

# After setup is complete
/agentful-start        # Begin development (auto-generates agents on first run)

# To analyze existing spec
/agentful-product      # Check readiness, find gaps

# To check if setup is healthy
/agentful-analyze      # Validate configuration
```

## Troubleshooting

**Setup fails mid-way**
→ Run `/agentful-init` again - it will offer to resume

**Want to start over**
→ Delete `.agentful/setup-progress.json`, then run `/agentful-init`

**Already initialized, ran by mistake**
→ Choose "Continue with existing setup" when prompted

**Questions too basic/advanced**
→ Your answer to Q7 (experience level) adjusts future agent verbosity
