# /agentful-agents

Discover domain patterns in your codebase and generate specialized domain agents with comprehensive documentation.

## Overview

The `/agentful-agents` command automatically discovers business domains in your codebase and generates specialized agents for them. Unlike tech stack agents (like `nextjs-specialist`) that handle framework patterns, domain agents understand your business logic like billing, inventory, authentication, or content management.

This command:

- Analyzes your code structure to discover logical domains
- Uses parallel exploration agents to identify patterns
- Validates findings with confidence scores
- Generates domain-specific agents with real examples from your code
- Creates comprehensive documentation for each agent
- Updates your architecture metadata

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
/agentful-agents
```

This will:
1. Auto-detect your current project state
2. Run appropriate workflow based on what exists
3. Discover domain patterns (if code exists)
4. Present findings with confidence scores
5. Ask for confirmation before generating anything
6. Generate agents in parallel with validation

### After Architecture Analysis

```bash
# Recommended: Run after initial architecture setup
/agentful-start
# Architecture analyzed, tech stack agents created

/agentful-agents
# Now discover business domain agents
```

## Auto-Detection Process

The command intelligently determines what to do based on your project state:

```
1. Check for substantial codebase
   → No code? Enter NO_CODEBASE mode

2. Check for architecture.json
   → Missing? Enter NEED_ARCHITECTURE mode

3. Run domain discovery
   → Enter DISCOVERY mode (main workflow)
```

## Modes

### Mode 1: NO_CODEBASE (No Code to Analyze)

When no substantial codebase exists yet.

**What you'll see:**

```
⚠️  No Codebase Detected

I can't discover domain agents because there's no code to analyze yet.

Domain agents are specialized agents for your project's business domains
(e.g., billing, authentication, inventory, content management).

Options:

  [1] Start building features first
      Run /agentful-start to implement features.
      I'll discover domains as your code grows.

  [2] Manually define domains
      You can create domain agents yourself in .claude/agents/

  [3] Skip for now
      Continue with core agents (backend, frontend, tester, etc.)

Your choice: > _______________________________
```

**Why this matters:** Domain agents are discovered from actual code patterns, not assumptions. You need implemented features before domains can be identified.

### Mode 2: NEED_ARCHITECTURE (Missing Architecture Analysis)

When `.agentful/architecture.json` doesn't exist.

**What you'll see:**

```
🔍 Architecture Analysis Needed

Before discovering domain agents, I need to understand your tech stack
and code patterns.

This will:
  - Detect your programming language and frameworks
  - Identify code organization patterns
  - Generate specialized tech stack agents (e.g., nextjs-specialist)

Run /agentful-start first, which will:
  1. Trigger architect agent to analyze your project
  2. Generate tech stack agents
  3. Then you can run /agentful-agents to discover domain agents

Would you like to run /agentful-start now? (y/n): > _______________________________
```

**Why this matters:** Domain discovery builds on top of architecture analysis. The command needs to understand your tech stack before identifying business domains.

### Mode 3: DISCOVERY (Main Workflow)

When codebase exists and architecture is analyzed.

This is the primary workflow with four steps:

#### Step 1: Parallel Domain Exploration

The command spawns four parallel explorer agents:

**1. Cohesion Explorer** - Analyzes file clustering and module coupling
- Looks for file clusters with high internal coupling
- Analyzes import graphs to find interdependent modules
- Identifies folders with cohesive purpose
- Outputs confidence based on coupling strength

**2. Naming Explorer** - Analyzes naming patterns
- Scans for business domain terms in file/folder/class names
- Detects consistent naming patterns
- Finds domain prefixes (BillingService, AuthController)
- Outputs confidence based on naming consistency

**3. Database Explorer** - Analyzes data layer
- Analyzes database schemas and models
- Identifies entity relationships that define domains
- Finds bounded contexts in data layer
- Outputs confidence based on entity cohesion

**4. API Explorer** - Analyzes API structure
- Maps API routes to business capabilities
- Identifies controller/handler groupings
- Finds REST resource patterns
- Outputs confidence based on route organization

Each explorer outputs domain candidates with:
- Domain name
- Confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)
- Evidence supporting the finding
- List of relevant files

#### Step 2: Validate and Aggregate Findings

After explorers complete, a validator agent:
- Merges overlapping domain candidates
- Calculates composite confidence scores
- Filters out low-confidence results (< 60%)
- Checks existing agents in `.claude/agents/`
- Identifies gaps where domains exist but no agent

**Confidence calculation:**
```
composite_confidence = (
  cohesion_score * 0.3 +
  naming_score * 0.2 +
  database_score * 0.3 +
  api_score * 0.2
)

Only include if composite_confidence >= 0.6
```

#### Step 3: Present Findings to User

**Example output:**

```

Existing domain agents:
  • authentication (already covered)

Core agents status: ✅ All present
  • backend, frontend, tester, reviewer, fixer, architect, orchestrator

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Would you like to generate agents for the discovered domains?

This will create:
  • .claude/agents/billing.md
  • .claude/agents/inventory.md

Each agent will include:
  - Domain-specific patterns from your code
  - Real examples from your codebase
  - Business logic guidelines
  - Integration patterns
  - Documentation

Generate agents? (y/n): > _______________________________
```

#### Step 4: Generate Domain Agents

If you confirm, the command spawns parallel generator agents:

**For each domain:**
- Analyzes representative files from the domain
- Extracts real code patterns (never placeholders)
- Documents business rules
- Creates integration patterns
- Generates agent file (`.claude/agents/domain.md`)
- Generates documentation (`.claude/agents/domain.README.md`)

**Validation:**
- All generated agents validated for quality
- Must have real examples (not placeholders)
- Must follow project conventions
- Must be syntactically correct markdown
- Failed agents regenerated automatically

**Example generated agent structure:**

```markdown
---
name: billing
description: Handles all billing, subscriptions, and payment logic for this project
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
---

# Billing Agent

You implement billing features for this project.

## Your Scope

- Subscription management (create, update, cancel, upgrade/downgrade)
- Invoice generation and handling
- Payment processing via Stripe
- Proration calculations
- Webhook handling for Stripe events

## NOT Your Scope

- User authentication → @backend or @auth
- Frontend components → @frontend
- Tests → @tester

## Project-Specific Patterns

[Real patterns extracted from code]

## Real Examples from This Project

```typescript
// Actual pattern from src/billing/subscription.service.ts
export class SubscriptionService {
  async createSubscription(userId: string, planId: string) {
    const plan = await this.plans.findById(planId);
    // ... real implementation from your code
  }
}
```

## Business Rules

1. **Subscription Lifecycle**:
   - All subscriptions must have a Stripe subscription ID
   - Status changes go through: trial → active → past_due → canceled

2. **Proration**:
   - Always use Stripe's built-in proration
   - Never calculate proration manually

[More domain-specific rules from your code]

## Integration Patterns

[How this domain integrates with others]

## Rules

1. ALWAYS follow patterns from real examples
2. NEVER introduce new patterns without user approval
3. ALWAYS use Stripe for payment processing
4. ALWAYS handle webhook idempotency
```

**Final output:**

```

## Discovery Process

### How Domains Are Discovered

Domains are **never hardcoded**. The command discovers them by analyzing actual code patterns:

**Strong domain signals:**
- Multiple files in dedicated folder (src/billing/)
- Consistent naming across files (BillingService, billing.controller.ts)
- Dedicated API routes (/api/billing/*)
- Related database models (subscriptions, invoices, payments)
- High internal coupling, low external coupling

**Weak domain signals (filtered out):**
- Single file claiming to be a domain
- Generic names (utils, helpers, common)
- Low confidence scores (< 60%)
- No clear boundaries or purpose

### Confidence Scoring

Each domain gets a confidence score:

| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 85-100% | Very strong domain | Highly recommend creating agent |
| 70-84% | Strong domain | Recommend creating agent |
| 60-69% | Moderate domain | Consider creating agent |
| < 60% | Weak signal | Filter out, likely false positive |

### What Gets Generated

For each discovered domain:

**1. Domain Agent File** (`.claude/agents/domain.md`)
- Agent definition with frontmatter
- Scope and responsibilities
- Real code examples from your project
- Business rules extracted from code
- Integration patterns
- Error handling strategies
- Database schema documentation

**2. Domain Documentation** (`.claude/agents/domain.README.md`)
- Domain overview
- When to use this agent
- Architecture diagrams
- Common patterns
- Integration points
- Key responsibilities
- Example usage

**3. Architecture Metadata** (`.agentful/architecture.json` updated)
- Domain metadata
- Confidence scores
- File counts
- Key files
- External services
- Database models

## Output Files

### Generated Agent Files

```
.claude/agents/
├── billing.md              # Domain agent
├── billing.README.md       # Domain documentation
├── inventory.md            # Domain agent
├── inventory.README.md     # Domain documentation
└── [domain].md             # More domains as discovered
```

**Why not in `auto-generated/`?**
- These are domain agents (business logic), not tech stack agents
- They should be customized by users for specific business rules
- They contain project-specific patterns that may change

### Architecture Metadata

Updates `.agentful/architecture.json`:

```json
{
  "domains": [
    {
      "name": "billing",
      "confidence": 0.89,
      "agent_path": ".claude/agents/billing.md",
      "file_count": 15,
      "key_files": [
        "src/billing/subscription.service.ts",
        "src/billing/invoice.service.ts"
      ],
      "external_services": ["Stripe"],
      "database_models": ["Subscription", "Invoice", "Payment"]
    }
  ],
  "domain_discovery": {
    "last_run": "2026-01-20T00:00:00Z",
    "method": "multi-explorer",
    "explorers_used": ["cohesion", "naming", "database", "api"],
    "domains_discovered": 3,
    "agents_generated": 2,
    "agents_skipped": 1
  }
}
```

## When to Use

### Ideal Times to Run /agentful-agents

| Situation | Command | Why |
|-----------|---------|-----|
| After initial development | `/agentful-agents` | Code patterns now visible |
| Architecture analyzed | `/agentful-start` → `/agentful-agents` | Prerequisites met |
| Major feature completed | `/agentful-agents` | New domain may have emerged |
| Periodic discovery | `/agentful-agents` | Find new domains as code grows |
| Manual agents needed | `/agentful-agents` | Save time vs writing from scratch |

### When NOT to Use

| Situation | Alternative |
|-----------|-------------|
| No code exists yet | Implement features first with `/agentful-start` |
| Architecture not analyzed | Run `/agentful-start` first |
| Small codebase (< 10 files) | Wait until more code exists |
| Just tech stack agents needed | Architect agent handles this automatically |

## Re-running Discovery

You can run `/agentful-agents` multiple times as your codebase evolves:

**On re-run:**
- Compares current code vs last analysis
- Detects new files and patterns
- Discovers domains that emerged since last run
- Skips existing agents (won't overwrite without asking)
- Updates architecture.json with new findings

**Example:**

```
🔍 Re-analyzing Domains

Last discovery: 3 days ago

Changes detected:
  • 12 new files in src/notifications/
  • New API routes: /api/notifications/*
  • Database tables added: notifications, preferences

Running discovery again...

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

New domain discovered:

1. notifications           ████████░░ 82%
   Evidence:
   • 12 files in src/notifications/
   • API endpoints for push/email/sms
   • Database tables for notifications

   Status: No agent exists
   Recommendation: CREATE AGENT

════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Would you like to generate an agent for notifications? (y/n)
```

## Integration with Other Commands

### Before: /agentful-start

Run `/agentful-start` before `/agentful-agents`:

```bash
# 1. Start development (triggers architecture analysis)
/agentful-start

# 2. Implement some features
# ... autonomous development runs ...

# 3. Discover domain agents
/agentful-agents
```

**Why this order?**
- Architecture analysis creates `.agentful/architecture.json`
- Implemented features provide code patterns to discover
- Domain agents build on top of tech stack agents

### After: Use in Development

Once agents are generated, use them in development:

```bash
# Mention domain agents in prompts
"Hey @billing, add support for annual subscriptions"
"Hey @inventory, implement stock reservation system"

# Or via /agentful-start
/agentful-start
# Orchestrator automatically delegates to domain agents
```

### Continuous: Periodic Discovery

As your codebase grows:

```bash
# After major feature
/agentful-start  # Implement feature
/agentful-agents # Discover new domains

# Monthly check
/agentful-agents # See if new domains emerged
```

## Quality Checklist

Generated agents must have:

- Real code examples (NO placeholders like "[insert code]")
- Domain-specific business rules
- Clear scope definition
- Integration patterns with other domains
- Error handling strategies
- Database schema documentation (if applicable)
- External service documentation (if applicable)
- Proper markdown formatting
- Valid frontmatter

Documentation must have:

- Domain overview
- When to use this agent
- Architecture diagrams (if complex)
- Common patterns and examples
- Integration points
- Key responsibilities

## Examples by Scenario

After you have some code, run /agentful-agents again.
```

### Scenario 3: Missing Architecture

```bash
$ /agentful-agents

🔍 Architecture Analysis Needed

Run /agentful-start first to analyze your tech stack.

Would you like to run /agentful-start now? (y/n): > y

Delegating to /agentful-start...

# Architecture analysis runs
# Tech stack detected
# Tech stack agents generated

After architecture analysis completes, run /agentful-agents.
```

### Scenario 4: Re-Discovery

```bash
$ /agentful-agents

🔍 Re-analyzing Domains

Last discovery: 3 days ago
Detected changes: 12 new files in src/notifications/

# Discovery runs again
# 1 new domain found
# User confirms

✅ Generated agent: notifications
```

## Tips and Best Practices

### Discovery Tips

1. **Run after implementing features**
   - Wait until you have 20+ files
   - Domain patterns more visible with more code

2. **Re-run periodically**
   - After major features
   - Monthly for active projects
   - When new business capabilities added

3. **Review findings carefully**
   - High confidence (85%+) = strong signal
   - Low confidence (60-69%) = may be false positive
   - Check evidence before confirming

4. **Customize generated agents**
   - They're starting points, not final versions
   - Add project-specific rules
   - Update as business logic evolves

### Agent Usage Tips

1. **Use domain agents for business logic**
   ```bash
   # Good
   "@billing, implement subscription upgrades"
   "@inventory, add low-stock alerts"

   # Not as good
   "@backend, add billing feature"  # Too generic
   ```

2. **Let orchestrator delegate**
   ```bash
   # The orchestrator automatically picks the right agent
   /agentful-start
   # Sees "billing" task → delegates to @billing
   ```

3. **Combine with tech stack agents**
   ```bash
   # Domain agents work with tech stack agents
   "@billing and @nextjs-specialist, create checkout page"
   ```

### Maintenance Tips

1. **Update agents as code evolves**
   - Manually edit `.claude/agents/domain.md`
   - Add new patterns discovered
   - Update business rules

2. **Keep architecture.json current**
   - Re-run `/agentful-agents` periodically
   - Updates metadata automatically

3. **Document integration points**
   - How domains interact
   - Shared data models
   - API contracts

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No domains discovered"

**Cause:** Codebase too small or no clear patterns

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check file count
ls -R src/ | wc -l

# If < 20 files, wait until more code exists
/agentful-start  # Implement more features

# Then try again
/agentful-agents
```

### Issue: "Low confidence scores"

**Cause:** Code structure doesn't show clear domain boundaries

**Solution:**
- Organize code into domain folders (src/billing/, src/auth/)
- Use consistent naming patterns
- Group related files together
- Re-run discovery after reorganizing

### Issue: "Generated agent has placeholders"

**Cause:** Validation failed to catch it

**Solution:**
```bash
# Manually fix the agent file
# Or delete and regenerate
rm .claude/agents/domain.md
/agentful-agents  # Regenerate
```

### Issue: "Want to regenerate an agent"

**Cause:** Need to update agent with new patterns

**Solution:**
```bash
# Option 1: Manually edit
# Edit .claude/agents/domain.md

# Option 2: Delete and regenerate
rm .claude/agents/domain.md
rm .claude/agents/domain.README.md
/agentful-agents  # Will detect missing and regenerate
```

### Issue: "Domain exists but not discovered"

**Cause:** Confidence score too low (< 60%)

**Solution:**
- Improve code organization for that domain
- Add more files to the domain
- Use consistent naming
- Or manually create agent in `.claude/agents/`

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Explorers

Add your own exploration logic:

```bash
# Create custom explorer
mkdir -p .agentful/explorers/
cat > .agentful/explorers/custom-explorer.md << 'EOF'
---
name: custom-domain-explorer
description: Custom logic for discovering domains specific to this project
---

# Custom Domain Explorer

[Your custom exploration logic]
EOF

# Command automatically uses custom explorers
/agentful-agents
```

### Manual Domain Agents

Create domain agents manually:

```bash
# Create agent file
cat > .claude/agents/my-domain.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-domain
description: Handles my custom business domain
---

# My Domain Agent

[Your domain-specific patterns and rules]
EOF

# Command will skip this domain in future discoveries
/agentful-agents  # Won't overwrite my-domain.md
```

### Batch Re-Discovery

Check all domains periodically:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# rediscover-domains.sh

# Compare last run timestamp
LAST_RUN=$(jq -r '.domain_discovery.last_run' .agentful/architecture.json)
DAYS_SINCE=$(( ($(date +%s) - $(date -d "$LAST_RUN" +%s)) / 86400 ))

if [ "$DAYS_SINCE" -gt 30 ]; then
  echo "Running monthly domain discovery..."
  /agentful-agents
else
  echo "Last run $DAYS_SINCE days ago. Skipping."
fi
```
