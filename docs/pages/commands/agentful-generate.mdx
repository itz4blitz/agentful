# /agentful-generate

Analyze codebase, detect tech stack, discover business domains, generate domain agents and tech skills.

:::warning[Most users never need to run this manually]
Agent generation happens **automatically** on your first `/agentful-start` run. Only use this command if your tech stack changes significantly after initial setup.
:::

## When Agents Are Generated

**Automatic generation (recommended):**
- ✅ First time you run `/agentful-start` in a new project
- ✅ Detects tech stack, discovers domains, generates agents/skills automatically
- ✅ No manual intervention required

**Manual regeneration (only if needed):**
- 🔄 Adding a new language (e.g., Python to a TypeScript project)
- 🔄 Switching architecture paradigms (e.g., REST API → GraphQL)
- 🔄 Adopting new major framework (e.g., Express → NestJS)
- 🔄 Adding new ORM or database technology

**Examples of when to re-run:**
```bash
# ❌ Don't rerun for minor changes
- Added a new npm package
- Created a new feature/domain in existing stack
- Fixed bugs or refactored code

# ✅ Rerun for major tech stack changes
- Migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript
- Added Python backend alongside Node.js
- Switched from REST to GraphQL API
- Changed from Prisma to Drizzle ORM
```

**How it works:**
1. First `/agentful-start`: Runs `/agentful-generate` automatically
2. Saves results to `.agentful/architecture.json`
3. Future runs: Uses cached architecture unless you manually regenerate

## Overview

`/agentful-generate` unifies domain discovery and skill generation into a single command. It:

1. Detects your tech stack from config files
2. Discovers business domains from code structure
3. Generates domain agents for high-confidence domains
4. Generates tech skills for detected technologies
5. Creates architecture metadata

## Key Concepts

**Agents** = Actors that DO work. They have tools, write code, make decisions.
- Core agents: backend, frontend, tester, reviewer, fixer (always included)
- Domain agents: books, auth, billing, orders (generated from your code)

**Skills** = Knowledge that agents REFERENCE. Documentation and patterns.
- Tech skills: react, express, prisma, nextjs (generated from your stack)

## Usage

:::info[For Advanced Users]
This command is for manual regeneration only. First-time users should run `/agentful-start` instead, which handles generation automatically.
:::

```bash
# Manual regeneration (advanced users only)
/agentful-generate

# Example scenario: You migrated from Express to NestJS
/agentful-generate  # Regenerates skills with NestJS patterns
```

## Detection Process

### Step 1: Tech Stack Detection

Reads configuration files:
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml` - Python dependencies
- `go.mod` - Go dependencies
- `Cargo.toml` - Rust dependencies
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Database schema

Detects:
- **Language**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust
- **Framework**: Next.js, React, Vue, Express, NestJS, Django, Flask, FastAPI
- **ORM**: Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, Mongoose, SQLAlchemy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, SQLite
- **Testing**: Vitest, Jest, Playwright, pytest

### Step 2: Domain Discovery

Scans source code:
- Directory structure (src/auth/, src/billing/)
- API routes (api/auth/*, routes/books.ts)
- Service/controller files (authService.ts, bookController.ts)
- Database models (User, Book, Order)
- Frontend pages/components (Books.tsx, AuthorCard.tsx)

Evidence scoring:
- Directory named after domain: +10
- API routes for domain: +15
- Service/controller files: +8
- Database models: +5
- Frontend pages/components: +5

**Confidence** = score / 50 * 100 (max 100%)

**Threshold**: Domain agent generated only if confidence >= 75%

### Step 3: Generation Plan

Shows plan and waits for confirmation:

```
Tech Stack Detected:
  - TypeScript
  - React 18 + Vite
  - Express 4
  - Prisma + SQLite

Domains Discovered:
  - books (95% confidence) ✓ Will generate agent
  - authors (95% confidence) ✓ Will generate agent
  - stats (85% confidence) ✓ Will generate agent
  - payments (40% confidence) ✗ Below threshold

Will Generate:

  Domain Agents (3):
    .claude/agents/books.md
    .claude/agents/authors.md
    .claude/agents/stats.md

  Tech Skills (4):
    .claude/skills/react/SKILL.md
    .claude/skills/express/SKILL.md
    .claude/skills/prisma/SKILL.md
    .claude/skills/typescript/SKILL.md

Proceed? (y/n)
```

## Generated Files

### Domain Agents

Created at `.claude/agents/<domain>.md`:

```markdown
---
name: <domain>
description: <Domain> domain - handles <responsibility>
model: sonnet
tools: Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash
---

# <Domain> Agent

## Your Scope
[Responsibilities based on discovered files]

## Domain Structure
[Actual files - services, controllers, routes, components]

## Implementation Guidelines
[Patterns from existing code]

## Boundaries
- Handles: [what this agent owns]
- Delegates to @backend: [general backend patterns]
- Delegates to @frontend: [general frontend patterns]
- Delegates to @tester: [testing]

## Rules
1. Stay within domain boundaries
2. Follow existing patterns in this domain
3. Coordinate with related domains via clear interfaces
```

### Tech Skills

# <Tech> Skill

## Overview
[What this tech does in your project]

## Project Configuration
[Version, settings from config files]

## Common Patterns

### Architecture Metadata

Created at `.agentful/architecture.json`:

```json
{
  "techStack": {
    "languages": ["TypeScript"],
    "frontend": { "framework": "React", "version": "18.x" },
    "backend": { "framework": "Express", "version": "4.x" },
    "database": { "type": "SQLite", "orm": "Prisma" },
    "testing": ["Vitest", "Jest"]
  },

}
```

## When to Run

| Situation | Action | Reason |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **First `/agentful-start`** | Auto-runs | Initial tech stack detection |
| **Added new language** | Manual rerun | Python → TypeScript project |
| **Changed framework** | Manual rerun | Express → NestJS, REST → GraphQL |
| **Changed ORM/database** | Manual rerun | Prisma → Drizzle, MongoDB → PostgreSQL |
| **Added new feature** | ❌ No rerun needed | Use existing agents |
| **Refactored code** | ❌ No rerun needed | Architecture unchanged |
| **Added npm package** | ❌ No rerun needed | Minor dependency change |

## Example Output

```
✅ Generation Complete

Rerun /agentful-generate when codebase structure changes.
```

## Troubleshooting

### No domains discovered

**Cause**: Codebase too small or unclear structure

**Solution**:
- This is normal for new projects
- Implement features first with `/agentful-start` (uses core agents)
- As code grows, domains emerge naturally
- Rerun `/agentful-generate` only after significant domain structure appears

### Low confidence scores

**Cause**: Domain boundaries unclear

**Solution**:
- Group related files into domain folders
- Use consistent naming (authService, authController)
- Add API routes for domain
- Rerun after reorganizing

### Wrong tech stack detected

**Cause**: Config files ambiguous

**Solution**:
- Check package.json dependencies
- Verify framework imports in code
- Manually edit `.agentful/architecture.json`
- Rerun to regenerate skills
