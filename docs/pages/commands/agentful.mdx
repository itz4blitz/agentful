## How It Works

1. **Understands Intent** - Classifies what you want
2. **Checks Context** - Reads `.agentful` state/history, recent project context, and optional product docs
3. **Routes to Specialist** - Delegates to appropriate agent
4. **Provides Updates** - Shows progress, asks questions when needed

## Routing

`/agentful` automatically routes to specialized commands:

| Your Input | Routes To |
|-----------|-----------|
| "How's it going?" | `/agentful-status` |
| "Continue working" | `/agentful-start` |
| "What needs decisions?" | `/agentful-decide` |
| "Run tests" | `/agentful-validate` |
| "Add [feature]" | Orchestrator agent |

## When to Use

- Natural conversation
