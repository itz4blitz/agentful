# /agentful

The **main conversational interface** for agentful. Just talk naturally - no need to remember specific commands or syntax.

## Usage

\```bash
/agentful [your request in plain English]
\```

## Examples

```bash
# Start development
/agentful "Add user authentication"

# Check progress
/agentful "How's it going?"

# Fix bugs
/agentful "The login button isn't working"

# Get status
/agentful "What's left to build?"

# Continue work
/agentful "Keep going"
```

## What It Understands

### Status & Progress
- "How's it going?"
- "What's the status?"
- "What's left?"
- "Progress check"
- "What are you working on?"

### Feature Development
- "Add [feature]"
- "Build [feature]"
- "Create [feature]"
- "Implement [feature]"

Example: "Add user authentication with JWT"

### Bug Fixes
- "Fix [issue]"
- "The [component] is broken"
- "[feature] isn't working"

Example: "Fix the login redirect bug"

### Questions
- "What are we building?"
- "How does [feature] work?"
- "Tech stack?"
- "Architecture?"

### Actions
- "Continue" - Resume development
- "Stop" - Pause development
- "Run tests" - Execute validation

## How It Works

1. **Understands Intent** - Classifies what you want (status, feature, bugfix, etc.)
2. **Checks Context** - Reads product spec, state, and conversation history
3. **Routes to Specialist** - Delegates to appropriate agent (orchestrator, tester, etc.)
4. **Provides Updates** - Shows progress and asks questions when needed

## Example Conversations

### Feature Development

```bash
You:  /agentful "Add user profiles"

Agent: Got it! Starting user profiles development...
      [Analyzing project structure...]
      [Delegating to architect agent...]

Agent: User profiles feature plan created:
      • User profile data model
      • Profile CRUD API
      • Profile settings page
      Starting implementation...
```

### Status Check

```bash
You:  /agentful "How's it going?"

Agent: Overall Progress: ████████████░░░░ 45%

      Features:
      ✅ Authentication Backend  100%
      🔄 Authentication Frontend  45%
      ⏸ User Profiles              0%

      Currently working on: Login page component

```

### Bug Fix

```bash
You:  /agentful "The login button is broken"

Agent: Investigating login button issue...

      Tests passing. ✅
```
