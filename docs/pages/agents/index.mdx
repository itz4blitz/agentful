# Agents

Agents are autonomous workers that execute specific tasks in agentful. Each agent has a specialized role, tools, and knowledge base.

## Core Concept

**Agents are ACTORS that do work. Skills are KNOWLEDGE they reference.**

- **Agents** = Workers with tools (Read, Write, Bash, Task, etc.)
- **Skills** = Reusable knowledge bases (patterns, examples, best practices)

## Agent Types

### 1. Core Agents

Built-in agents that ship with agentful.

| Agent | Purpose | Tools | Model |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| [Orchestrator](/agents/orchestrator) | Coordinates work, delegates to specialists | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Task | Opus |
| [Architect](/agents/architect) | Analyzes tech stack, generates framework-specific agents | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Task | Opus |
| [Backend](/agents/backend) | Implements server-side code | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | Sonnet |
| [Frontend](/agents/frontend) | Implements client-side code | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | Sonnet |
| [Tester](/agents/tester) | Writes tests, ensures 80% coverage | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | Sonnet |
| [Reviewer](/agents/reviewer) | Validates code quality (9 checks) | Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Write, Edit | Sonnet |
| [Fixer](/agents/fixer) | Fixes issues found by Reviewer | Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash | Sonnet |

Location: `.claude/agents/*.md`

### 2. Generated Agents

Framework-specific agents created by Architect based on your tech stack.

**Examples:**
- `nextjs-specialist.md` - Next.js App Router, Server Components
- `prisma-agent.md` - Schema management, migrations
- `django-agent.md` - Models, views, ORM patterns
- `nestjs-agent.md` - Modules, controllers, services

Location: `.claude/agents/generated/*.md`

**Generation:** Run `/agentful-generate` to create agents for your stack.

### 3. Ephemeral Agents

Temporary agents for one-off tasks. Created on-demand, destroyed after completion.

**Use cases:**
- Database migrations
- Large-scale refactoring
- Security audits
- Data imports
- One-time cleanup

Location: `.claude/agents/ephemeral/`

Lifecycle: Created → Execute → Report → Archive/Delete

## Using Agents

### Manual Invocation

Tag agents with `@agent-name` in chat:

```
@backend Implement user authentication with JWT
@frontend Create login page with form validation
@tester Write tests for auth service
@reviewer Check all changes
```

### Automatic Delegation

The Orchestrator automatically delegates work:

```
User: "Build authentication"
  ↓
Orchestrator → @backend (API routes)
Orchestrator → @frontend (login page)
Orchestrator → @tester (tests)
Orchestrator → @reviewer (validation)
Orchestrator → @fixer (fix issues)
```

## Agent Workflow

Standard development cycle:

```
1. Orchestrator reads product spec
2. Delegates to Backend/Frontend for implementation
3. Delegates to Tester for test coverage
4. Delegates to Reviewer for validation
5. If issues found → Fixer → Reviewer again
6. Updates completion tracking
7. Continues to next feature
```

## Key Distinctions

### Reviewer vs Fixer

- **Reviewer** = DETECTS issues (runs 9 validation checks)
- **Fixer** = FIXES issues (reads `.agentful/last-review.json`)

Reviewer finds problems, Fixer solves them.

### Backend vs Frontend

- **Backend** = API routes, services, repositories, database
- **Frontend** = UI components, pages, hooks, state, styling

Agents never cross domains. Backend doesn't modify UI; Frontend doesn't touch APIs.

### Core vs Generated

- **Core agents** = General-purpose (works with any stack)
- **Generated agents** = Framework-specific (uses exact patterns for Next.js, Django, etc.)

Use generated agents when available for better code quality.

## Agent Communication

Agents communicate through:

1. **State files** - `.agentful/state.json`, `completion.json`, `decisions.json`
2. **Task tool** - Spawn other agents: `Task("backend", "implement X")`
3. **File system** - Shared codebase
4. **Review reports** - `.agentful/last-review.json`

## Model Selection

### Opus (Highest Reasoning)
- Orchestrator - Complex coordination
- Architect - Tech stack analysis

### Sonnet (Balanced)
- Backend, Frontend, Tester, Reviewer, Fixer - Implementation work

Opus = expensive but smarter. Sonnet = fast and capable for most tasks.

## Creating Custom Agents

See [Custom Agents](/agents/custom-agents) for:
- Creating specialized agents
- Supporting new technologies
- Building ephemeral agents
- Agent templates and patterns

## Monitoring Agents

Check agent activity:

```bash
# View state
cat .agentful/state.json

# View completion
cat .agentful/completion.json

# View pending decisions
cat .agentful/decisions.json

# View last review
cat .agentful/last-review.json
```

## Next Steps

- [Orchestrator](/agents/orchestrator) - Understand the coordinator
- [Backend](/agents/backend) - Server-side implementation patterns
- [Frontend](/agents/frontend) - Client-side implementation patterns
- [Reviewer](/agents/reviewer) - Quality validation process
- [Custom Agents](/agents/custom-agents) - Build your own agents
