# Writing Product Specifications

The quality of your product specification directly determines how well agentful can build your product. A well-written spec leads to autonomous development success. A vague spec leads to confusion, decisions, and delays.

---

## Why Product Specifications Matter

Product specifications are the **single source of truth** for agentful. It's where you define:

- **What** you're building (overview and features)
- **How** it should work (acceptance criteria)
- **With what** technologies (tech stack)
- **When** it's done (success criteria)

agentful reads your specification on every iteration. The clearer and more specific it is, the less it needs to ask you for decisions.

## The Golden Rule

> **Be specific. Be explicit. Use checklists.**

Vague requirements force agentful to stop and ask. Specific requirements let agentful work autonomously.

---

## Specification Structures: Flat vs Hierarchical

agentful supports **two organizational structures** for your product specifications. Both are valid - choose based on your project's complexity and team needs.

### Structure Overview

| Aspect | Flat Structure | Hierarchical Structure |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| **File Location** | `PRODUCT.md` or `.claude/product/index.md` | `.claude/product/domains/*/index.md` |
| **Best For** | Small to medium projects (3-15 features) | Large projects (15+ features) |
| **Domain Concept** | Sections within one file | Separate directories per domain |
| **Maintainability** | Easy for single author | Better for team collaboration |
| **Scalability** | Can get unwieldy past ~20 features | Scales to 50+ features |
| **Navigation** | Scroll through one file | Separate files per domain |

### Visual Comparison

**Flat Structure** (Single File):
```
.claude/product/index.md
├── Overview
├── Tech Stack
└── Features (by domain section)
    ├── Domain 1: Authentication
    │   ├── Feature 1.1
    │   └── Feature 1.2
    ├── Domain 2: Content Management
    │   ├── Feature 2.1
    │   └── Feature 2.2
    └── Domain 3: Analytics
        ├── Feature 3.1
        └── Feature 3.2
```

**Hierarchical Structure** (Directory Tree):
```
.claude/product/
├── index.md (overview + tech stack)
└── domains/
    ├── authentication/
    │   └── index.md (features 1.1, 1.2)
    ├── content-management/
    │   └── index.md (features 2.1, 2.2)
    └── analytics/
        └── index.md (features 3.1, 3.2)
```

### Decision Matrix

Choose **Flat Structure** if:
- ✓ Your project has 15 or fewer features
- ✓ You're a solo developer or small team
- ✓ All features fit in 3-6 logical domains
- ✓ You want simpler file management
- ✓ You prefer everything in one place

Choose **Hierarchical Structure** if:
- ✓ Your project has 15+ features
- ✓ Multiple team members own different domains
- ✓ You have 6+ distinct business domains
- ✓ Domains have complex interdependencies
- ✓ You want parallel domain development
- ✓ You need granular progress tracking

### Key Terminology Difference

**Important**: "Domain" means different things in each structure:

- **Flat**: Domains are **section headers** in your single file (organizational tool)
- **Hierarchical**: Domains are **actual directories** in your filesystem (architectural tool)

Both structures let you organize features by business domain - the difference is physical vs logical organization.

### Migration Path

You can always start flat and migrate to hierarchical:

1. **Start**: Flat structure for rapid iteration
2. **Grow**: Hit ~15 features or multiple contributors?
3. **Migrate**: Split into domain directories (see migration guide below)

---

## Organizing Features by Domain

Both flat and hierarchical structures use **domain-based organization**. This approach helps agentful better understand feature relationships, dependencies, and implementation order.

### What Are Domains?

**Domains** are high-level business areas that group related features together. Think of them as logical containers for functionality that belongs together.

**Examples of domains**:
- **Authentication & User Management** - User accounts, profiles, permissions
- **Content & Data Management** - CRUD operations, search, categorization
- **Communication & Collaboration** - Messaging, notifications, sharing
- **Commerce & Transactions** - Orders, payments, inventory
- **Analytics & Reporting** - Dashboards, charts, exports

### Why Use Domains?

1. **Better Organization**: Related features stay together, making the spec easier to navigate
2. **Clearer Dependencies**: Domains show what functionality depends on what
3. **Focused Development**: agentful can complete one domain before moving to the next
4. **Parallelizable Work**: Different domains can often be developed in parallel
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Future features have a clear place to belong

### How to Structure Domains

Use a three-level hierarchy:

```
Domain 1: [Domain Name]
  ├─ Feature 1.1 - [Priority]
  ├─ Feature 1.2 - [Priority]
  └─ Feature 1.3 - [Priority]

Domain 2: [Domain Name]
  ├─ Feature 2.1 - [Priority]
  └─ Feature 2.2 - [Priority]
```

In **flat structure**, these domains become section headers in one file.

In **hierarchical structure**, these domains become separate directories with their own files.

### Example: Task Management App

**Instead of a flat list**:
```markdown
## Features
1. User Authentication - CRITICAL
2. Task Management - HIGH
3. Real-time Updates - MEDIUM
4. User Profile - LOW
5. Team Collaboration - MEDIUM
```

**Use domains**:
```markdown
## Features

### Domain 1: Authentication & User Management
#### 1.1 User Authentication - CRITICAL
[Details...]

#### 1.2 User Profile - LOW
[Details...]

### Domain 2: Task & Project Management
#### 2.1 Task Management - HIGH
[Details...]

#### 2.2 Real-time Updates - MEDIUM
[Details...]

### Domain 3: Team Collaboration
#### 3.1 Team Features - MEDIUM
[Details...]
```

### Domain Best Practices

1. **Start with Critical Domains**: Begin with domains that contain CRITICAL priority features
2. **Limit Domain Count**: 3-6 domains is optimal for most projects
3. **Balance Features**: Each domain should have 2-5 features
4. **Clear Boundaries**: Features should clearly belong to one domain (no overlap)
5. **Logical Flow**: Order domains by dependency (authentication → content → analytics)

### Identifying Your Domains

Ask yourself:

1. **What are the main business areas?**
   - E-commerce: Products, Orders, Customers, Marketing
   - SaaS: Users, Billing, Content, Analytics
   - Social: Profiles, Connections, Content, Messaging

2. **What features belong together?**
   - Group features that share data models
   - Group features used by the same users
   - Group features with similar technical requirements

3. **What depends on what?**
   - Authentication usually comes first
   - Core content before analytics
   - Basic CRUD before advanced features

### Migrating from Flat to Hierarchical

When your flat file becomes unwieldy (15+ features or multiple contributors):

**Step 1: Create domain directories**
```bash
mkdir -p .claude/product/domains/authentication
mkdir -p .claude/product/domains/content-management
mkdir -p .claude/product/domains/analytics
```

**Step 2: Split your flat file**
- Move overview + tech stack to `.claude/product/index.md`
- Create `index.md` in each domain directory
- Move feature sections to appropriate domain files
- Add domain overview and dependencies to each file

**Step 3: Update the main index**
- Add "## Domains" section listing all domains
- Include file paths for each domain
- Maintain same numbering scheme (1.1, 1.2, 2.1, etc.)

**Step 4: Test the structure**
```bash
# agentful will read the hierarchical structure automatically
agentful status
```

**Key**: Feature numbering stays consistent (1.1, 2.1, etc.) regardless of structure.

### Design Patterns

- [Any specific patterns to use]
- [Any patterns to avoid]

### Constraints

- [Performance requirements]
- [Accessibility requirements]
- [Browser support requirements]

## Third-Party Integrations (Optional)

- [API 1]: [Purpose and usage notes]
- [API 2]: [Purpose and usage notes]

- [Feature X] - Will add in v2
- [Feature Y] - Out of scope
- [Feature Z] - Not needed

## Success Criteria

The product is complete when:

1. [All critical features implemented and tested]
2. [All tests passing with 80%+ coverage]

4. [No security vulnerabilities]
5. [Deployed to production]

## Notes

[Any additional context, links, or documentation]
```

---

## Section by Section Guide

### Overview

**Purpose**: Quick understanding of what you're building.

**Length**: 2-3 sentences.

**Include**:
- What the product is
- Who it's for
- Key value proposition

**Good Example**:
```markdown
## Overview
A task management application for remote teams. Users can create projects, add tasks with deadlines, assign team members, and track progress with real-time updates.
```

**Bad Example**:
```markdown
## Overview
A task app.  # Too vague - agentful doesn't know what features to include
```

---

### Goals

**Purpose**: Define success metrics.

**Format**: Checkbox list (so you can track progress).

**Good Example**:
```markdown
## Goals

- [ ] Users can register and login
- [ ] Users can create projects and tasks
- [ ] Users can assign tasks to team members
- [ ] Real-time updates when tasks change
- [ ] Mobile-responsive design
```

**Tip**: Keep goals high-level. Features are where you get specific.

---

### Tech Stack

**Purpose**: Tell agentful what technologies to use.

**Critical**: Be explicit. Don't make agentful guess.

#### Frontend

```markdown
### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
```

**Why this matters**:
- agentful generates specialized agents based on your stack
- Different frameworks have different patterns (Next.js app router vs pages)
- Testing setup depends on the framework

#### Backend

```markdown
### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Next.js API Routes
- **Language**: TypeScript
```

**Tip**: If using Next.js, backend is often integrated. Specify if using a separate backend server.

#### Database

```markdown
### Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
```

**Common choices**:
- **PostgreSQL + Prisma** - Most common, production-ready
- **SQLite + Prisma** - Good for local development, simple apps
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** - Flexible schema, document-based
- **None** - In-memory state for simple apps

**Be specific** about the ORM. Prisma != Drizzle != TypeORM.

#### Authentication

```markdown
### Authentication
- **Method**: JWT with httpOnly cookies
```

**Options**:
- **JWT** - Stateless, scalable, common
- **Sessions** - Simple, built-in to many frameworks
- **Clerk/Auth0** - Managed services, faster setup
- **None** - If no auth needed for MVP

#### Testing

```markdown
### Testing
- **Unit**: Vitest
- **E2E**: Playwright
```

**Common pairs**:
- **Vitest + Playwright** - Modern, fast
- **Jest + Cypress** - Traditional, widely-used

#### Deployment

```markdown
### Deployment
- **Hosting**: Vercel
```

**agentful uses this to**:
- Set build configurations
- Configure environment variables
- Add deployment scripts

---

### Features (The Most Important Section)

**This is where most PRODUCT.md files fail.** Follow these patterns carefully.

#### Structure

Every feature needs:

```markdown
### [Priority Number]. [Feature Name] - [PRIORITY LEVEL]

**Description**: [One sentence explaining what this feature does]

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Specific, testable requirement]
- [ ] [Specific, testable requirement]
- [ ] [Specific, testable requirement]

**User Stories** (optional):
- As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]

**Technical Notes** (optional):
- [Implementation hints or constraints]
```

#### Priority Levels

Use these consistently:

- **CRITICAL** - Must have for MVP. agentful works on these first.
- **HIGH** - Important, but can wait slightly.
- **MEDIUM** - Nice to have.
- **LOW** - Future improvements.

#### Acceptance Criteria (The Secret Sauce)

**Good acceptance criteria are:**

1. **Specific** - Clear what "done" looks like
2. **Testable** - Can write a test for it
3. **Complete** - Cover all key aspects
4. **Checkable** - Can verify with a checkbox

##### Examples

**❌ Vague (Bad)**:
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] User can login
- [ ] Authentication works
- [ ] Security is good
```

**Why this fails**: agentful doesn't know:
- What fields to include (email? username?)
- What validation to apply
- How to handle errors
- What "good security" means

**✅ Specific (Good)**:
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Login form with email and password fields
- [ ] Email validation: required, valid format
- [ ] Password validation: required, min 8 characters
- [ ] On success: store JWT token in httpOnly cookie, redirect to /dashboard
- [ ] On failure: show inline error message with specific reason
- [ ] Prevent login for unverified emails (show "check your email" message)
- [ ] Rate limiting: max 5 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
```

**Why this works**: agentful knows exactly what to build. No decisions needed.

---

#### Writing Great Acceptance Criteria

##### Pattern 1: User Input

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Input field for [field name]
- [ ] Validation: [required, format, min/max length]
- [ ] Placeholder text: "[example]"
- [ ] Error messages for invalid input
- [ ] Submit button that validates before submitting
```

##### Pattern 2: API Endpoints

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] POST /api/auth/login endpoint
- [ ] Request body: { email: string, password: string }
- [ ] Response success: { user: {...}, token: "..." } with 200 status
- [ ] Response error: { error: "specific message" } with 401 status
- [ ] Hash passwords with bcrypt before comparing
- [ ] Return JWT token valid for 7 days
```

##### Pattern 3: Data Display

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Display list of [items]
- [ ] Show [field 1], [field 2], [field 3] for each item
- [ ] Loading state while fetching data
- [ ] Empty state with message when no items exist
- [ ] Error state with retry button when fetch fails
```

##### Pattern 4: User Actions

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] [Button/Action] triggers [action]
- [ ] Confirmation prompt: "[message]"
- [ ] On confirm: [what happens]
- [ ] On cancel: [what happens]
- [ ] Success notification: "[message]"
- [ ] Error handling with specific message
```

---

#### User Stories (Optional but Helpful)

**Format**:
```markdown
**User Stories**:
- As a [user type], I want [feature] so that [benefit]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
**User Stories**:
- As a registered user, I want to login with my email and password so that I can access my projects
- As a security-conscious user, I want rate limiting on login attempts so that my account can't be brute-forced
```

**Why include these**: Helps agentful understand context and make better decisions when ambiguity exists.

---

#### Technical Notes (When Needed)

Use this section to guide implementation when you have specific requirements:

```markdown
**Technical Notes**:
- Use React Hook Form for form validation
- Store session in httpOnly cookie for security
- Implement rate limiting using Redis (or in-memory if Redis unavailable)
- Follow existing auth pattern in src/lib/auth.ts
```

**When to include**:
- You have existing code agentful should follow
- You need a specific library or pattern
- There are performance constraints
- There are security requirements

**When to skip**:
- Let agentful decide the implementation
- You don't have a strong preference
- The "how" doesn't matter, only the "what"

---

### Architecture Notes (Optional)

**Purpose**: Guide structural decisions without micromanaging.

**Use when**:
- You have an existing codebase to match
- You have strong architectural preferences
- You're working with a team that needs consistency

**Example**:
```markdown
### Folder Structure
```
src/
├── app/              # Next.js app router
├── components/       # React components
│   ├── ui/          # Reusable UI components
│   └── features/    # Feature-specific components
├── lib/              # Utilities and helpers
├── hooks/            # Custom React hooks
├── services/         # API services
└── types/            # TypeScript types
```

### Design Patterns
- Use React Hook Form for all forms
- Use TanStack Query for data fetching
- Use Zod for runtime validation
- Follow atomic design for components

### Constraints
- All API routes must return { data, error } format
- All components must be TypeScript strict
- Mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
```

---

### Out of Scope (for MVP)

**Purpose**: Explicitly state what you're NOT building.

**Why this matters**: Prevents agentful from wasting time on features you don't want.

**Example**:
```markdown
## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- **User profiles** - Will add in v2, focus on core functionality first
- **Email notifications** - Out of scope for now, users check dashboard
- **Real-time collaboration** - Too complex for MVP, will use polling
- **Mobile apps** - Web-only for MVP
- **Payment processing** - Free tier only for launch
```

**Tip**: Be explicit. If you don't list it here, agentful might add it if it seems related to your features.

---

### Success Criteria

**Purpose**: Define when agentful is "done".

**Example**:
```markdown
## Success Criteria

The product is complete when:

1. All CRITICAL and HIGH priority features are implemented and tested
2. All tests passing with 80%+ coverage
3. No type errors (adapts to stack)
4. No security vulnerabilities (npm audit passes)
5. Manual testing confirms all user stories work
6. Deployed to production and accessible
```

**agentful uses this to**:
- Know when to stop working
- Prioritize validation checks
- Determine if a feature is truly complete

## Common Product Specification Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Vague Requirements

**❌ Bad**:
```markdown
### 1. User Authentication - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can login

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Login works
- [ ] Security is good
```

**✅ Good**:
```markdown
### 1. User Authentication - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can login with email and password

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Login form with email and password fields
- [ ] Email validation: required, valid format
- [ ] Password validation: required, min 8 chars
- [ ] On success: JWT in httpOnly cookie, redirect to /dashboard
- [ ] On failure: inline error with specific reason
- [ ] Rate limiting: max 5 attempts per 15 min per IP
```

---

### Mistake 2: Missing Tech Stack Details

**❌ Bad**:
```markdown
## Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Database
```

**✅ Good**:
```markdown
## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

### Backend
- **Framework**: Next.js API Routes
- **Language**: TypeScript

### Database
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Prisma
```

---

### Mistake 3: No Priorities

**❌ Bad**:
```markdown
## Features
1. Authentication
2. User profiles
3. Email notifications
4. Dark mode
5. Admin panel
```

**✅ Good**:
```markdown
## Features

### 1. Authentication - CRITICAL
...

### 2. User profiles - HIGH
...

### 3. Email notifications - MEDIUM
...

### 4. Dark mode - LOW
...

### 5. Admin panel - LOW
...
```

**Why priorities matter**: agentful works CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW. Without priorities, it might work on dark mode before authentication.

---

### Mistake 4: No Acceptance Criteria

**❌ Bad**:
```markdown
### 1. Shopping Cart - CRITICAL
Users can add items to cart and checkout.
```

**✅ Good**:
```markdown
### 1. Shopping Cart - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can add items to cart and checkout

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Cart icon shows item count badge
- [ ] Add to cart button on product page
- [ ] Cart drawer shows items with quantities
- [ ] Update quantity with +/- buttons
- [ ] Remove items from cart
- [ ] Subtotal calculation
- [ ] Checkout button (disabled if empty)
- [ ] Cart persists in localStorage
```

---

### Mistake 5: Acceptance Criteria That Aren't Testable

**❌ Bad**:
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] UI looks good
- [ ] Code is clean
- [ ] Performance is fast
```

**✅ Good**:
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Components follow design system spacing (4px grid)
- [ ] All functions have single responsibility
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds on 3G
```

---

### Mistake 6: Too Much Implementation Detail

**❌ Bad** (over-specifying):
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Use React Hook Form with useForm hook
- [ ] Validate with Zod schema on line 15
- [ ] Call API endpoint /api/auth/login exactly
- [ ] Store token in cookie named 'auth_token'
- [ ] Use useEffect to fetch user data on mount
- [ ] Use useState for form state
```

**✅ Good** (focus on what, not how):
```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Login form with email/password fields
- [ ] Client-side validation before submission
- [ ] POST to /api/auth/login with credentials
- [ ] Store auth token securely
- [ ] Fetch and display user data on successful login
```

**Let agentful figure out the "how"**. You specify the "what".

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Simple, Then Expand

**First version**:
```markdown
### 1. Todo List - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can see their todos

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Display list of todos
- [ ] Each todo shows text
```

**Then expand**:
```markdown
### 1. Todo List - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can see and manage their todos

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Display list of todos
- [ ] Each todo shows text and completion status
- [ ] Filter: all / active / completed
- [ ] Sort by date added (newest first)
- [ ] Empty state with illustration
- [ ] Loading state while fetching
- [ ] Error state with retry button
```

**Why**: Start with core functionality, then add polish after agentful completes the basics.

---

### 2. Use Examples in Acceptance Criteria

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Email validation accepts formats like:
  - user@example.com
  - first.last@example.co.uk
  - user+tag@example.com
- [ ] Email validation rejects formats like:
  - user@ (no domain)
  - @example.com (no user)
  - user.example (no @)
```

**Why**: Examples make requirements concrete and testable.

---

### 3. Be Explicit About Edge Cases

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Handle empty input gracefully
- [ ] Handle network errors with retry button
- [ ] Handle duplicate submissions (disable button on submit)
- [ ] Handle malicious input (sanitize user input)
- [ ] Handle expired auth tokens (auto-refresh or re-login)
```

**Why**: agentful will handle edge cases if you specify them. Otherwise, it might miss them.

---

### 4. Reference Existing Patterns

If you have existing code:

```markdown
**Technical Notes**:
- Follow existing auth pattern in src/lib/auth.ts
- Match component structure in src/components/ui/
- Use same error handling pattern as src/app/api/products/route.ts
```

**Why**: Ensures consistency with your existing codebase.

---

### 5. Think About User Experience

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Show loading state within 100ms of action (optimistic UI)
- [ ] Display success message for 3 seconds before auto-dismissing
- [ ] Confirm destructive actions with dialog
- [ ] Provide undo for non-destructive actions (like delete)
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts: Enter to submit, Escape to cancel
```

**Why**: Great products are about UX, not just functionality.

---

### 6. Consider Performance Early

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] List items render with virtualization for 100+ items
- [ ] Images lazy load below the fold
- [ ] API responses include pagination (max 50 items per page)
- [ ] Cache GET requests for 5 minutes
- [ ] Debounce search input by 300ms
```

**Why**: Performance is easier to build in than retrofit later.

---

### 7. Plan for Testing

```markdown
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Unit tests for all business logic functions
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] E2E tests for critical user flows (login, checkout)
- [ ] Mock external dependencies (Stripe API, email service)
```

**Why**: agentful's tester agent needs to know what to test.

---

### 8. Use "Don't" Sections

```markdown
**What NOT to do**:
- Don't use alerts for errors (use toast notifications)
- Don't hardcode strings (use i18n keys for future localization)
- Don't store sensitive data in localStorage
- Don't use any for types (be specific)
```

**Why**: Explicitly preventing bad patterns saves time.

## Updating PRODUCT.md Mid-Development

### When to Update

**Safe to update**:
- Adding new LOW priority features
- Clarifying ambiguous acceptance criteria
- Adding technical notes for current work
- Updating success criteria

**Risky to update**:
- Changing priorities of in-progress features
- Removing features agentful is working on
- Completely changing tech stack mid-development
- Modifying acceptance criteria of completed features

### How to Update Safely

1. **Run /agentful-status** to see what's in progress
2. **Only update features not yet started**
3. **Check .agentful/state.json** for current phase
4. **If changing priorities**, explain why in "Notes" section

**Example safe update**:
```markdown
## Notes

**[2026-01-18]** - Adding feature #8 (Dark mode) as LOW priority.
All CRITICAL and HIGH features complete, so this is safe to add.
```

---

## Tools for Better PRODUCT.md

### PRODUCT.md Validators

```bash
# Check for common issues
npx agentful validate-product

# Output:
✓ Overview present
✓ Tech stack specified
✓ Features prioritized
⚠ Feature 3 has no acceptance criteria
⚠ Feature 5 is vague: "Make it fast"
```

### PRODUCT.md Templates

```bash
# Generate a template for your stack
npx agentful template --stack nextjs,prisma,tailwind

# Outputs a ready-to-fill PRODUCT.md with your stack pre-configured
```

---

## Summary: The Perfect Product Specification

The perfect product specification is:

1. **Specific** - No vague requirements
2. **Complete** - Covers all critical aspects
3. **Organized** - Features grouped by domain
4. **Prioritized** - Clear order of work
5. **Testable** - Every requirement can be verified
6. **Explicit** - Tech stack fully specified
7. **Scoped** - Out of scope section prevents creep
8. **Achievable** - Success criteria are realistic
9. **Well-Structured** - Flat or hierarchical based on project size

**Choosing the Right Structure**:
- **Flat (PRODUCT.md or .claude/product/index.md)**: Start here for most projects
- **Hierarchical (.claude/product/domains/*/index.md)**: Migrate when you hit 15+ features or multiple team members

**Remember**: You can always start flat and migrate to hierarchical later. Feature numbering stays consistent (1.1, 2.1, etc.) regardless of structure.

**Invest time in your product specification upfront, and agentful will reward you with autonomous development success.**

## Next Steps

Now that you have a great PRODUCT.md:

1. **[Start agentful](../getting-started/quick-start)** - Begin autonomous development
2. **[Monitor Progress](../commands/agentful-status)** - Track completion
3. **[Handle Decisions](../commands/agentful-decide)** - Answer when agentful asks
4. **[Validate Quality](../commands/agentful-validate)** - Ensure all gates pass
