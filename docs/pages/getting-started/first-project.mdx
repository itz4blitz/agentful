# Your First Project

Build a task management app from scratch.

## Project Overview

**What we're building**:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks complete
- Delete tasks
- Filter by status

**Tech Stack**:
- Next.js 15 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Local state (no database)
- Vitest for testing

**Time**: 30-45 minutes

## Step 1: Initialize Project

```bash
mkdir task-manager
cd task-manager
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
claude
```

## Step 2: Define Product Specification

Edit `.claude/product/index.md` to define what you want to build:

```markdown
# Product Specification

## Overview
A simple task management application for personal productivity.

## Goals
- [ ] Users can add tasks
- [ ] Users can mark tasks complete
- [ ] Users can delete tasks
- [ ] Users can filter tasks by status
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Framework: Next.js 15
- Language: TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- State Management: React useState

### Testing
- Unit: Vitest

## Features (Priority Order)

### 1. Add Task - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can add new tasks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Input field for task description
- [ ] Add button
- [ ] Task appears in list
- [ ] Input clears after adding
- [ ] Validation: empty tasks not allowed
- [ ] Validation: max 200 characters

**Technical Notes**:
- Use input with text type
- Show error message for invalid input
- Focus input after adding

### 2. Toggle Task Completion - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can mark tasks complete/incomplete

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Checkbox to toggle

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Filter buttons: All, Active, Completed
- [ ] Only show tasks matching filter
- [ ] Active filter highlighted
- [ ] Task count updates per filter

**Technical Notes**:
- Use button group for filters
- Update count when filter changes

**Description**: Display count of remaining tasks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Show "X tasks left" text
- [ ] Updates in real-time
- [ ] Only counts active (incomplete) tasks

## Architecture Notes

### Folder Structure

src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx          # Main task manager page
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Root layout
│   └── globals.css       # Global styles
├── components/
│   ├── TaskList.tsx      # Task list component
│   ├── TaskItem.tsx      # Individual task
│   ├── TaskInput.tsx     # Add task input
│   └── TaskFilters.tsx   # Filter buttons
└── lib/
    └── types.ts          # TypeScript types

### Design Patterns
- TypeScript for all components
- Functional components with hooks
- Explicit props interfaces
- Separation of concerns

### Constraints
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Client-side only
- Tailwind utility classes

## Success Criteria
1. All critical and high features implemented
2. All tests passing with 80%+ coverage
3. No type errors
4. No lint errors
5. Responsive on mobile (375px+)
6. Accessible with keyboard
```

## Step 3: Start Development

With your product spec defined, start the development loop:

```bash
/agentful-start
```

agentful will:
1. Analyze your product spec
2. Generate specialized agents for your stack
3. Begin implementing features in priority order

## Step 4: Watch agentful Work

agentful now works through your features automatically. Watch the terminal for progress updates. See the [Overview](/getting-started/overview) for detailed workflow information.

**You'll see:**
```
Orchestrator planning work...
Feature queue:
1. Add Task (CRITICAL)
2. Toggle Task Completion (CRITICAL)
3. Delete Task (HIGH)
4. Filter Tasks (MEDIUM)
5. Task Counter (LOW)

Starting: Add Task feature
```

**Phase 3: Implementation**
```
Frontend Agent implementing...
Created:
- src/lib/types.ts
- src/components/TaskInput.tsx
- src/components/TaskList.tsx
- src/components/TaskItem.tsx
- src/app/page.tsx
```

**Phase 4: Testing**
```
Tester Agent writing tests...
Created:
- src/components/__tests__/TaskInput.test.tsx
- src/components/__tests__/TaskList.test.tsx
- src/components/__tests__/TaskItem.test.tsx

Running tests... 14 passing
```

**Phase 5: Validation**
```
Reviewer Agent validating...
TypeScript: ✓ No errors
ESLint: ✓ No errors
Tests: ✓ All passing
Coverage: ✓ 87%

Feature complete: Add Task (100%)
```

Process repeats for each feature.

## Step 5: Monitor Progress

Check progress anytime:

```bash
/agentful-status
```

Output:
```
Working on: Filter Tasks feature
Phase: implementation
Iterations: 15

Progress: 60%

Features:
✓ Add Task (100%)
✓ Toggle Task Completion (100%)
✓ Delete Task (100%)
• Filter Tasks (40%)
○ Task Counter (0%)

Quality Gates:
✓ Tests Passing (42/42)
✓ No Type Errors
✓ Coverage 87%

```

## Step 6: Handle Decisions

If agentful needs input:

```
Decision needed:
For "Delete Task", should we:
1. Show confirmation dialog before deleting
2. Delete immediately without confirmation
```

Answer:

```bash
/agentful-decide
```

Then provide your choice:
```
Option 2: Delete immediately
```

agentful resumes immediately.

## Step 7: Review Results

When complete, review:

```bash
# View structure
tree src/components

# Test coverage
npm run test -- --coverage

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Lint
npm run lint

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and test all features.

## What agentful Built

### File Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── components/
│   ├── TaskInput.tsx
│   ├── TaskList.tsx
│   ├── TaskItem.tsx
│   └── TaskFilters.tsx
├── lib/
│   └── types.ts
└── components/
    └── __tests__/
        ├── TaskInput.test.tsx
        ├── TaskList.test.tsx
        ├── TaskItem.test.tsx
        └── TaskFilters.test.tsx
```

### Features Implemented

- Add Task (input with validation)
- Toggle Completion (checkbox with strikethrough)
- Delete Task (remove button)
- Filter Tasks (All/Active/Completed)
- Task Counter ("X tasks left")
- Responsive Design (mobile-first Tailwind)
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA)
- Tests (48 tests, 87% coverage)

## Common Issues

### agentful stops mid-development

Check status:
```bash
/agentful-status
```

Look for:
- Pending decisions → `/agentful-decide`
- High iteration count → Check for blocking decisions
- Errors → `/agentful-validate`

### Tests failing

Let agentful handle it. Fixer agent will:
1. Identify failing tests
2. Fix implementation
3. Re-run tests
4. Continue when passing

### TypeScript errors

Fixer agent resolves these. If persistent:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# Fix manually if needed
/agentful-start  # Continue development
```

## Customizing Your Project

### Add New Features

Edit `.claude/product/index.md`:
```markdown
### 6. Task Due Dates - MEDIUM
**Description**: Add due dates to tasks

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Date picker on add task
- [ ] Display due date on task
- [ ] Sort by due date
```

Then:
```bash
/agentful-start
```

agentful will detect the new feature and work on it.

### Modify Existing Features

Update acceptance criteria in `.claude/product/index.md`, then run `/agentful-start` to continue.

### Add Domain Structure

For complex projects, organize into domains:

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/product/domains/tasks
mv .claude/product/index.md .claude/product/index.md.bak
# Split content into domain files
```

## Recap

You built a complete task management app with:

- 5 features fully implemented
- 48 tests passing
- 87% test coverage
- No type errors
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features
- In 30-45 minutes

**Key Learnings**:

1. **Intelligent Init** - agentful analyzes and creates appropriate structure
2. **Product Structure** - Hierarchical `.claude/product/` with optional domain organization
3. **Agent Generation** - `/agentful-start` auto-generates stack-specific agents on first run
4. **Progress Monitoring** - `/agentful-status` shows what's being worked on
5. **Quality Automation** - Tests, type checking, linting enforced automatically

**Next Steps**:

- Build more complex projects with domain organization
- Customize agentful for your specific stack
- Deploy your project
