# Your First Project

Build your first complete autonomous project with agentful. We'll create a **Task Management App** together.

---

## Project Overview

**What we're building:**
A simple task management application where users can:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Filter by status

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Local state (no database)
- Vitest for testing

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner

---

## Step 1: Initialize Project (5 minutes)

### Create Project Directory

```bash
mkdir task-manager
cd task-manager
```

### Initialize Next.js App

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

Follow prompts (press Enter for defaults).

### Initialize agentful

```bash
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
```

**Expected output:**
```
    ___    __  ____________  ____  ___   ____________
   /   |  / / / /_  __/ __ \/ __ \/ _ | / ____/  _/ /
  / /| | / / / / / / /_/ / /_/ /  __ |/ /    / // /
 / ___ |/ /_/ / / / / _, _/ _, _/ /_/ / /___/ // /
/_/  |_|_____/ /_/_/ /_/ |_/_/ |_|\____/\____/___/

                   v1.0.0

Creating .claude/ directory structure...
Initializing state files...
Creating template files...
  ✓ Created CLAUDE.md
  ✓ Created .claude/product/index.md (hierarchical structure)

Added .agentful/ to .gitignore

✅ agentful initialized successfully!

Next steps:
  1. Edit your product specification (see options below)
  2. Run: claude
  3. Type: /agentful-start
```

> **Choose Your Structure**
>
> agentful supports two ways to define your product:
>
> **Simple Projects** (recommended for first-time users):
> - Use a flat `PRODUCT.md` file in your project root
> - Everything in one place
> - Easier to get started
>
> **Complex Projects** (for larger applications):
> - Use `.claude/product/` directory with multiple files
> - Organize by domains/features
> - Scales better for big projects
>
> Both work identically - agentful auto-detects which you're using. For this tutorial, we'll use the simple `PRODUCT.md` approach.

---

## Step 2: Define Product (10 minutes)

Since we're building a simple task manager, we'll use the **flat `PRODUCT.md`** structure.

Create a file called `PRODUCT.md` in your project root and add:

> **Note**: If you prefer the hierarchical structure, you can edit `.claude/product/index.md` instead - the content is identical. agentful will auto-detect either approach.

## Architecture Notes

### Folder Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx          # Main task manager page
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Root layout
│   └── globals.css       # Global styles
├── components/
│   ├── TaskList.tsx      # Task list component
│   ├── TaskItem.tsx      # Individual task component
│   ├── TaskInput.tsx     # Add task input
│   └── TaskFilters.tsx   # Filter buttons
└── lib/
    └── types.ts          # TypeScript types
```

### Design Patterns

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interfaces explicitly defined
- Separation of concerns (UI, state, logic)

### Constraints

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Client-side only (no API routes needed)
- Use Tailwind utility classes

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- User authentication
- Task editing
- Task priorities
- Due dates
- Persistent storage (localStorage is fine)
- Cloud sync

## Success Criteria

The product is complete when:

1. All critical and high features implemented and tested
2. All tests passing with 80%+ coverage
3. No type errors (adapts to stack)
4. No lint errors
5. Responsive on mobile (375px+)
6. Accessible with keyboard

## Notes

- Keep it simple - this is a learning project
- Focus on clean code and tests
- Use TypeScript strictly (no any types)
- Follow Tailwind best practices
- Write tests as you go (via agentful)
```

→ @tester writing toggle tests
→ @reviewer validating quality

Feature complete: Toggle Task Completion (100%)

Next: Delete Task
→ @frontend implementing delete functionality
...
```

This continues until all features are complete.

---

## Step 5: Monitor Progress (ongoing)

While agentful works, check progress anytime:

```
/agentful-status
```

**Example output during development:**

```
🔧 Working on: Filter Tasks feature
   Phase: implementation
   Iterations: 15

Progress:
   ████████████░░░░░░░ 60%

Features:
   ✅ Add Task (100%)
   ✅ Toggle Task Completion (100%)
   ✅ Delete Task (100%)
   🔄 Filter Tasks (40%)
   ⏳ Task Counter (0%)

Quality Gates:
   ✅ Tests Passing (42/42)
   ✅ No Type Errors
   ✅ Coverage 87%
   ✅ No Dead Code
   ✅ No Security Issues

No pending decisions.

Next Actions:
   • /agentful-start    - Continue development
   • /agentful-validate - Run quality checks
```

---

## Step 6: Handle Decisions (if needed)

agentful may ask for clarification:

```
⚠️  Decision needed:

For the "Delete Task" feature, should we:
1. Show confirmation dialog before deleting
2. Delete immediately without confirmation

Context: This affects user experience. Confirmation is safer but
adds friction. Immediate delete is faster but riskier.
```

**To answer:**

```
/agentful-decide
```

Then provide your preference:
```
Option 2: Delete immediately without confirmation
We can add undo functionality in v2 if needed.
```

agentful will immediately resume with your decision.

---

## Step 7: Review Results (5 minutes)

When agentful completes (100%), review what was built:

### Check Generated Files

```bash
# View component structure
tree src/components

# View test coverage
npm run test -- --coverage

# Run TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Test the App

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and test:
1. Add a task
2. Mark it complete
3. Delete it
4. Try filters

### Review Code Quality

```bash
# Final validation
/agentful-validate
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ All tests passing (48/48)
✅ No type errors (adapts to stack)
✅ No ESLint errors
✅ Test coverage: 87%
✅ No dead code detected
✅ No security issues

Project complete! 🎉
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: agentful stops mid-development

**Symptom:** No progress after 5+ minutes

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check status
/agentful-status

# Look for:
# - Pending decisions? → /agentful-decide
# - High iteration count? → /agentful-start to resume
# - Errors? → /agentful-validate
```

### Issue: Tests failing

**Symptom:** Red test output

**Solution:**
Let agentful handle it. The Fixer agent will:
1. Identify failing tests
2. Fix implementation
3. Re-run tests
4. Continue when passing

### Issue: Low test coverage

**Symptom:** Coverage < 80%

**Solution:**
agentful will automatically add more tests. Watch for:
```
🧪 Tester Agent: Adding edge case tests...
Coverage now: 82% ✅
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors

**Symptom:** Type errors in output

**Solution:**
The Fixer agent will resolve these. If persistent:
```bash
# Check specific errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Manually fix if needed
# Then /agentful-start to continue
```

---

## Customizing Your Project

After agentful completes, you can:

### Add New Features

**If using PRODUCT.md** (flat structure):

Edit `PRODUCT.md`:
```markdown
### 6. Task Due Dates - MEDIUM
**Description**: Add due dates to tasks
...
```

**If using hierarchical structure** (.claude/product/):

Edit `.claude/product/index.md` or add a new domain file like `.claude/product/domains/tasks.md`:
```markdown
### 6. Task Due Dates - MEDIUM
**Description**: Add due dates to tasks
...
```

Then:
```bash
/agentful-start
```

### Modify Existing Features

**If using PRODUCT.md**:

Update acceptance criteria in `PRODUCT.md`:
```markdown
### 1. Add Task - CRITICAL
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Input field for task description
- [ ] Add button
- [ ] Priority selector (Low/Medium/High) ← NEW
...
```

**If using hierarchical structure**:

Update the relevant domain file in `.claude/product/domains/`

Then:
```bash
/agentful-start
```

### Switch Between Structures

You can switch between flat and hierarchical anytime:

- **Flat → Hierarchical**: Move `PRODUCT.md` → `.claude/product/index.md` and split into domain files
- **Hierarchical → Flat**: Merge all `.claude/product/**/*.md` into single `PRODUCT.md`

agentful auto-detects the change on next run.

### Change Styling

Edit components directly:
```tsx
// src/components/TaskItem.tsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 ...">  // Change color
```

agentful won't overwrite manual edits unless you run `/agentful-start` again.
