# Your First Project

Build your first complete autonomous project with agentful. We'll create a **Task Management App** together, demonstrating both simple and complex project structures.

---

## Project Overview

**What we're building:**
A task management application where users can:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Filter by status

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Local state (no database)
- Vitest for testing

**Time:** 30-45 minutes
**Difficulty:** Beginner

**What you'll learn:**
- How agentful intelligently detects your project structure
- How to use both flat and hierarchical product structures
- How to use `/agentful` for natural conversation
- How to monitor progress with `/agentful-status`
- How agentful builds complete features autonomously

---

## Step 1: Initialize Project

### Create Project Directory

```bash
mkdir task-manager
cd task-manager
```

### Initialize Next.js App

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"
```

Follow prompts (press Enter for defaults).

### Initialize agentful

```bash
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
```

**Expected output:**
```
   █████╗  ██████╗ ███████╗███╗   ██╗████████╗███████╗██╗   ██╗██╗

                   v0.1.1

🔍 Analyzing your project...

  Language:    TypeScript
  Frameworks:  Next.js, React
  Package Mgr: npm
  Build:       Next.js

📊 Detected domains:

  • Task Management     ██████████ 90%
  • UI Components      ████████░░ 75%

  Analysis completed in 1.8s (82% confidence)

📄 Using flat product structure (detected simple project)
  ✓ Created PRODUCT.md
  ✓ Created CLAUDE.md

Added .agentful/ to .gitignore

✅ agentful initialized successfully!

Next steps:
  1. Edit your product specification (PRODUCT.md)
  2. Run: claude
  3. Type: /agentful (natural) or /agentful-start (autonomous)
```

**What just happened:**
1. agentful analyzed your Next.js project
2. Detected the tech stack (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind)
3. Found 2 domains (Task Management, UI Components)
3. Since < 3 domains, it chose the **flat structure** and created `PRODUCT.md`
4. If you had ≥3 domains, it would have created `.claude/product/` with domain directories

> **Understanding Structure Detection**
>
> **Simple Projects** (flat `PRODUCT.md`):
> - Detected when project has < 3 domains, 0-1 frameworks, not a monorepo
> - Everything in one file at project root
> - Perfect for: learning, MVPs, single-purpose apps
>
> **Complex Projects** (hierarchical `.claude/product/`):
> - Detected when project has ≥3 domains, multiple frameworks, or is a monorepo
> - Organized by domain directories
> - Perfect for: multi-domain apps, large teams, long-term projects
>
> **You can switch anytime** - agentful auto-detects on each run!

---

## Step 2: Define Your Product

For this tutorial, we'll use the **flat `PRODUCT.md`** structure that agentful created.

Create a file called `PRODUCT.md` in your project root:

```markdown
# Product Specification

---

## Architecture Notes

### Folder Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── page.tsx          # Main task manager page
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Root layout
│   └── globals.css       # Global styles
├── components/
│   ├── TaskList.tsx      # Task list component
│   ├── TaskItem.tsx      # Individual task component
│   ├── TaskInput.tsx     # Add task input
│   └── TaskFilters.tsx   # Filter buttons
└── lib/
    └── types.ts          # TypeScript types
```

### Design Patterns

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Functional components with hooks
- Props interfaces explicitly defined
- Separation of concerns (UI, state, logic)

### Constraints

- Mobile-first responsive design
- Accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Client-side only (no API routes needed)
- Use Tailwind utility classes

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- User authentication
- Task editing
- Task priorities
- Due dates
- Persistent storage (localStorage is fine)
- Cloud sync

## Success Criteria

The product is complete when:

1. All critical and high features implemented and tested
2. All tests passing with 80%+ coverage
3. No type errors (adapts to stack)
4. No lint errors
5. Responsive on mobile (375px+)
6. Accessible with keyboard

## Notes

- Keep it simple - this is a learning project
- Focus on clean code and tests
- Use TypeScript strictly (no any types)
- Follow Tailwind best practices
- Write tests as you go (via agentful)
```

---

### Alternative: Hierarchical Structure Example

If agentful had detected a complex project (≥3 domains), it would have created `.claude/product/` instead. Here's how the same product would look with hierarchical structure:

**`.claude/product/index.md`:**
```markdown
# Product Specification

## Overview
A task management application for personal productivity.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes (not needed)
- **Database**: None (local state)
- **Testing**: Vitest

## Domains
1. **Task Management** - See domains/task-management/ for details
2. **UI Components** - See domains/ui-components/ for details
3. **User Interaction** - See domains/user-interaction/ for details
```

**`.claude/product/domains/task-management/index.md`:**
```markdown
# Task Management Domain

## Overview
Handle core task CRUD operations and state management.

## Features

### 1. Add Task - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can add new tasks to their list

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Input field for task description
- [ ] Add button
- [ ] Task appears in list after adding
- [ ] Input clears after adding
- [ ] Validation: empty tasks not allowed
- [ ] Validation: max 200 characters

### 2. Delete Task - HIGH
**Description**: Users can delete tasks they no longer need

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Delete button on each task
- [ ] Confirmation before deleting (optional)
- [ ] Task removes from list after deletion
```

**`.claude/product/domains/ui-components/index.md`:**
```markdown
# UI Components Domain

## Overview
Task display and interaction components.

## Features

### 1. Task List Display - CRITICAL
**Description**: Show tasks in a clean, organized list

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Scrollable list container
- [ ] Empty state message
- [ ] Loading state (if needed)
```

**`.claude/product/domains/user-interaction/index.md`:**
```markdown
# User Interaction Domain

## Overview
User interactions with tasks (completion, filtering).

## Features

### 1. Toggle Task Completion - CRITICAL
**Description**: Users can mark tasks as complete/incomplete

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Checkbox or click to toggle
- [ ] Visual indicator for completed tasks
- [ ] Completion status persists

### 2. Filter Tasks - MEDIUM
**Description**: Users can filter tasks by completion status

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Filter buttons: All, Active, Completed
- [ ] Only show tasks matching selected filter
- [ ] Active filter highlighted
```

**Key differences:**
- Features organized by domain (logical grouping)
- Multiple files, easier for team collaboration
- Better for large projects with many features
- agentful auto-detects and works with either structure

---

## Step 3: Choose Your Development Mode

agentful supports two ways to build:

### Option A: Natural Conversation Mode (Interactive)

**Best for:** Learning, exploring, getting advice, making decisions

```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```
/agentful
```

**Example conversation:**
```
You: I want to start building this task manager
agentful: Great! I've analyzed your PRODUCT.md. I can see you want to build a task
        manager with Next.js 14 and TypeScript. I detected 5 features prioritized by
        importance.

        I recommend we start with the "Add Task" feature since it's CRITICAL.
        This will create the foundation for the other features.

        Does this approach work for you?

You: Yes, that sounds good
agentful: Perfect. I'll:
        1. Create the Task type definition
        2. Build the TodoInput component
        3. Create the TodoList container
        4. Add state management
        5. Write comprehensive tests

        Ready to start?

You: Go ahead
agentful: Starting implementation...
        ✓ Created src/lib/types.ts
        ✓ Created src/components/TodoInput.tsx
        ...

You: Wait, can we add a character limit to the input?
agentful: Absolutely! I'll add a 200 character limit with validation.
        Updating TodoInput component...
        ✓ Added maxLength prop and validation
        ✓ Updated tests to cover edge cases

        Should I continue with the rest of the feature?

You: Yes
agentful: Continuing...
```

**Benefits:**
- Talk naturally, like pairing with a senior developer
- Make decisions as you go
- Get explanations for choices
- Change direction mid-stream
- Learn best practices

### Option B: Autonomous Mode (Hands-off)

**Best for:** Hands-off development, 24/7 building, maximum productivity

```bash
claude
```

Then type:
```
/agentful-start
```

agentful will:
1. Analyze your product spec
2. Generate specialized agents for your stack
3. Start building features autonomously
4. Continue until complete or paused
5. Only stop when it needs a decision

**Benefits:**
- No micromanagement needed
- Works 24/7 with Ralph Wiggum
- Maximum productivity
- Predictable workflow

**For this tutorial**, we'll use **autonomous mode** to see agentful's full power, but you can switch to conversation mode anytime!

---

## Step 4: Start Development (30 seconds)

### Start Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### Begin Autonomous Development

In the Claude prompt, type:

```

```

**Phase 6: Next Feature (continues)**

```
Next: Toggle Task Completion
→ @frontend implementing toggle functionality
→ @tester writing toggle tests
→ @reviewer validating quality

Feature complete: Toggle Task Completion (100%)

Next: Delete Task
→ @frontend implementing delete functionality
...
```

This continues until all features are complete.

---

## Step 6: Monitor Progress (ongoing)

While agentful works, check progress anytime:

```
/agentful-status
```

**Example output during development:**

```
🔧 Working on: Filter Tasks feature
   Phase: implementation
   Iterations: 15
   Current task: Creating filter button group

Progress:
   ████████████░░░░░░░ 60%

Features:
   ✅ Add Task (100%)
   ✅ Toggle Task Completion (100%)
   ✅ Delete Task (100%)
   🔄 Filter Tasks (40%)
   ⏳ Task Counter (0%)

Quality Gates:
   ✅ Tests Passing (42/42)
   ✅ No Type Errors (TypeScript detected)
   ✅ Coverage 87%
   ✅ No Dead Code
   ✅ No Security Issues

Reading from: PRODUCT.md (flat structure)
Detected stack: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS

No pending decisions.

Next Actions:
   • /agentful-start    - Continue development
   • /agentful-status   - Check progress (you are here)
   • /agentful-decide   - Answer pending decisions
   • /agentful-validate - Run quality checks
   • /agentful          - Switch to conversation mode
```

**Try conversation mode mid-development:**
```
/agentful
```
```
You: How's the filter feature coming along?
agentful: Great! I'm 40% through the Filter Tasks feature. I've created:
        ✓ FilterButtonGroup component
        ✓ Filter state management
        • Currently working on: Task filtering logic

        Should be done in about 5 more iterations. Want me to continue?

You: Yes, but can we also add a task counter showing how many are left?
agentful: Good idea! I'll add the Task Counter feature after this one.
        It's already in your product spec as LOW priority, so I'll get to it
        after the current feature completes.

        Anything else you'd like to adjust?

You: No, that's it
agentful: Perfect! Continuing with Filter Tasks...
```

**Benefits of checking status:**
- See exactly what agentful is working on
- Track completion percentage
- View quality gate status
- Know if decisions are pending
- Switch to conversation mode to make changes

---

## Step 7: Handle Decisions (if needed)

agentful may ask for clarification:

```
⚠️  Decision needed:

For the "Delete Task" feature, should we:
1. Show confirmation dialog before deleting
2. Delete immediately without confirmation

Context: This affects user experience. Confirmation is safer but
adds friction. Immediate delete is faster but riskier.
```

**To answer using autonomous mode:**

```
/agentful-decide
```

Then provide your preference:
```
Option 2: Delete immediately without confirmation
We can add undo functionality in v2 if needed.
```

**Or answer using conversation mode:**

```
/agentful
```
```
You: Let's go with option 2, no confirmation
agentful: Got it! Immediate delete it is.
        Updating implementation...
        ✓ Removed confirmation dialog
        ✓ Updated tests

        Feature complete: Delete Task (100%)

        Ready to move on to Filter Tasks?
```

agentful will immediately resume with your decision.

---

## Step 8: Review Results

When agentful completes (100%), review what was built:

### Check Generated Files

```bash
# View component structure
tree src/components

# View test coverage
npm run test -- --coverage

# Run TypeScript check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Test the App

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 and test:
1. Add a task
2. Mark it complete
3. Delete it
4. Try filters

### Review Code Quality

```bash
# Final validation
/agentful-validate
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ All tests passing (48/48)
✅ No type errors (adapts to stack)
✅ No ESLint errors
✅ Test coverage: 87%
✅ No dead code detected
✅ No security issues

Project complete! 🎉
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: agentful stops mid-development

**Symptom:** No progress after 5+ minutes

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check status
/agentful-status

# Look for:
# - Pending decisions? → /agentful-decide
# - High iteration count? → /agentful-start to resume
# - Errors? → /agentful-validate
```

### Issue: Tests failing

**Symptom:** Red test output

**Solution:**
Let agentful handle it. The Fixer agent will:
1. Identify failing tests
2. Fix implementation
3. Re-run tests
4. Continue when passing

### Issue: Low test coverage

**Symptom:** Coverage < 80%

**Solution:**
agentful will automatically add more tests. Watch for:
```
🧪 Tester Agent: Adding edge case tests...
Coverage now: 82% ✅
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors

**Symptom:** Type errors in output

**Solution:**
The Fixer agent will resolve these. If persistent:
```bash
# Check specific errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# Manually fix if needed
# Then /agentful-start to continue
```

---

## Customizing Your Project

After agentful completes, you can:

### Add New Features

**If using PRODUCT.md** (flat structure):

Edit `PRODUCT.md`:
```markdown
### 6. Task Due Dates - MEDIUM
**Description**: Add due dates to tasks
...
```

**If using hierarchical structure** (.claude/product/):

Edit `.claude/product/index.md` or add a new domain file like `.claude/product/domains/tasks.md`:
```markdown
### 6. Task Due Dates - MEDIUM
**Description**: Add due dates to tasks
...
```

Then:
```bash
/agentful-start
```

### Modify Existing Features

**If using PRODUCT.md**:

Update acceptance criteria in `PRODUCT.md`:
```markdown
### 1. Add Task - CRITICAL
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Input field for task description
- [ ] Add button
- [ ] Priority selector (Low/Medium/High) ← NEW
...
```

**If using hierarchical structure**:

Update the relevant domain file in `.claude/product/domains/`

Then:
```bash
/agentful-start
```

### Switch Between Structures

You can switch between flat and hierarchical anytime:

- **Flat → Hierarchical**: Move `PRODUCT.md` → `.claude/product/index.md` and split into domain files
- **Hierarchical → Flat**: Merge all `.claude/product/**/*.md` into single `PRODUCT.md`

agentful auto-detects the change on next run.

### Change Styling

Edit components directly:
```tsx
// src/components/TaskItem.tsx
<div className="bg-blue-500 ...">  // Change color
```

agentful won't overwrite manual edits unless you run `/agentful-start` again.

✅ 5 features fully implemented
✅ 48 tests passing
✅ 87% test coverage
✅ No type errors (TypeScript detected automatically)
✅ Responsive design
✅ Accessibility features
✅ All in 30-45 minutes

**What you learned:**

### 1. Intelligent Init
- agentful analyzes your project during init
- Automatically detects the best structure (flat vs hierarchical)
- Creates appropriate files based on project complexity
- Detects your tech stack and generates specialized agents

### 2. Product Structures
- **Flat (`PRODUCT.md`)** - Simple projects, everything in one file
- **Hierarchical (`.claude/product/`)** - Complex projects, organized by domains
- **Auto-detection** - agentful detects and works with either structure
- **Switch anytime** - Change structures as your project grows

### 3. Two Development Modes
- **Autonomous (`/agentful-start`)** - Hands-off, 24/7 development
- **Conversation (`/agentful`)** - Natural interaction, make decisions, explore options
- **Switch mid-stream** - Use conversation mode to adjust course, then resume

### 4. Progress Monitoring
- `/agentful-status` - See what's being worked on
- Track completion percentage and quality gates
- Identify pending decisions
- Switch modes to make changes

### 5. Natural Conversation Interface
- Talk to agentful like a senior developer
- Get advice before implementing
- Make mid-course corrections
- Learn why agentful makes certain decisions

### 6. Quality Automation
- Tests written automatically
- Type checking adapts to your stack
- Linting and coverage enforced
- Security scanning included

**You're now ready to:**
- Build more complex projects with hierarchical structure
- Use natural conversation for exploratory development
- Run 24/7 autonomous development for big projects
- Switch between modes as needed
- Customize agentful for your specific stack

**Key Takeaways:**
1. agentful does the hard work - it detects structure, stack, and patterns automatically
2. No manual configuration needed - just edit your product spec and start building
3. Use conversation mode when learning, autonomous mode for productivity
4. Check status anytime to see progress and make adjustments
5. agentful adapts to YOUR project - not the other way around

Happy building! 🚀
