# What is agentful?

**agentful** is a Claude Code configuration that adds specialized agents, quality gates, and structured workflows to your development process. It transforms how you build software by providing autonomous development capabilities while keeping you in control of key decisions.

**[Configure Your Installation →](/)**

---

## Core Capabilities

agentful extends Claude Code with four key capabilities:

1. **Specialized Agents** - Backend, frontend, testing, review, orchestration
2. **Quality Gates** - Type checking, linting, test coverage, dead code detection
3. **Product Tracking** - Feature status, completion percentage, blocking decisions
4. **Smart Analysis** - Tech stack detection, pattern recognition, domain discovery

It's a `.claude/` directory structure with agents, commands, and skills that Claude Code loads automatically.

---

## Agent Architecture

Claude Code runs with different instruction sets depending on which agent you invoke. Each agent has explicit scope boundaries and responsibilities:

### Core Agents

- **`@orchestrator`** - Coordinates work, delegates to specialists, never writes code directly
- **`@architect`** - Analyzes tech stack, generates domain-specific agents
- **`@backend`** - Server-side logic, APIs, databases
- **`@frontend`** - UI components, state management, client code
- **`@tester`** - Test generation and execution
- **`@reviewer`** - Quality validation, security checks
- **`@fixer`** - Automated remediation of failures

### Specialized Agents

Beyond core agents, agentful can generate domain-specific agents based on your codebase:

- **`@auth-agent`** - Authentication and authorization patterns
- **`@payment-agent`** - Payment processing and billing
- **`@notification-agent`** - Email, SMS, push notifications
- **Custom agents** - Generated from your business logic

Each agent knows when to delegate to others and when a task is outside their scope.

## Development Workflow

The typical agentful workflow follows this pattern:

### 1. Define Product Specification

Create a structured product spec in `.claude/product/`:

```markdown
## Overview
Task management for distributed teams

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Vitest + Playwright

## Features
1. Authentication (CRITICAL)
2. Project management (HIGH)
3. Task assignment (MEDIUM)
```

### 2. Generate Domain Agents

Run `/agentful-generate` to analyze your codebase and generate:
- Domain-specific agents based on your business logic
- Tech stack skills for framework patterns
- Pattern-matched instructions from your actual code

### 3. Start Structured Development

Run `/agentful-start` to begin the automated development workflow:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '3rem' }}>
  <DevelopmentWorkflowPipeline
    currentStage="implement"
    completedStages={['spec']}
    failedStages={[]}
    interactive={false}
    showControls={false}
    animatedFlow={true}
    orientation="horizontal"
    height="600px"
  />
</div>

The workflow follows these stages:
1. **Product Specification** - Analyze requirements for completeness
2. **Implementation** - Domain agents build features
3. **Testing** - Generate comprehensive test coverage
4. **Quality Gates** - Validate code quality (see below)
5. **Review** - Final production readiness check
6. **Deploy** - Ship to staging and production

### 4. Human Checkpoints

The system pauses for your input on:
- Architectural decisions
- Library selection
- Security configurations
- API design choices
- Database schema changes

You remain in control while Claude handles implementation details.

---

## Quality Gates

All implementations are validated against six automated quality gates before deployment:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <QualityGateDashboard showOverallScore={true} interactive={true} />
</div>

Every feature must pass all six gates:

- **Type Checking** - Zero TypeScript/Flow errors
- **Linting** - Code follows style guide (ESLint, Biome, Ruff)
- **Tests** - All test suites passing
- **Coverage** - Minimum 80% code coverage
- **Security** - No vulnerable dependencies
- **Dead Code** - No unused exports or files

Gates adapt to your stack. The framework detects available tools and runs appropriate checks. When gates fail, the **Fixer** agent automatically attempts remediation.

## How It Works

### File Structure

agentful creates a specific directory structure in your project:

```
your-project/
├── CLAUDE.md               # Project context
├── .claude/                # Framework (version control)
│   ├── agents/
│   │   ├── orchestrator.md
│   │   ├── backend.md
│   │   ├── frontend.md
│   │   ├── tester.md
│   │   └── ephemeral/      # Generated agents (gitignored)
│   ├── commands/
│   │   ├── agentful-start.md
│   │   ├── agentful-status.md
│   │   └── agentful-validate.md
│   ├── skills/
│   │   ├── product-tracking/
│   │   └── validation/
│   ├── product/            # Product specification
│   │   ├── index.md
│   │   └── domains/
│   └── settings.json
└── .agentful/              # Runtime state (gitignored)
    ├── state.json
    ├── completion.json
    └── decisions.json
```

**Version Control**: `.claude/` and `CLAUDE.md`
**Gitignore**: `.agentful/` and `.claude/agents/ephemeral/`

### Tech Stack Detection

agentful automatically detects and adapts to your technology stack:

- **Languages**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C#, PHP, Ruby, Elixir
- **Frontend**: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js, Astro, SolidJS
- **Backend**: Express, Fastify, NestJS, Hono, Next.js API Routes
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB
- **ORMs**: Prisma, Drizzle, TypeORM, Mongoose
- **Testing**: Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, Pytest, JUnit

The system generates appropriate patterns and validations based on what it detects.

---

## New vs Existing Projects

### New Projects (No Code Yet)

1. Architect prompts for tech stack choices
2. Generates template agents from best practices
3. Implements first feature
4. Re-analyzes actual code
5. Updates agents with your specific patterns
6. Continues with refined agents

The system learns from your actual code and refines its approach.

### Existing Projects (With Code)

1. Architect samples your codebase
2. Detects patterns, conventions, and structure
3. Generates agents matching your exact style
4. Begins implementation following existing patterns

agentful adapts to your existing code rather than imposing new patterns.

---

## Extended Development Sessions

Use the [Ralph Wiggum plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum) for uninterrupted development:

```bash
claude
/plugin install ralph-wiggum@anthropics
/ralph-loop "/agentful-start" --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "AGENTFUL_COMPLETE"
```

This runs until:
- Feature is complete
- All quality gates pass
- Human decision is required

---

## What agentful Is Not

Important limitations to understand:

- **Not fully autonomous** - Requires human decisions on architecture and design
- **Not a testing framework** - Generates tests but needs infrastructure
- **Not a deployment system** - Focused on development, not operations
- **Not a replacement for developers** - Accelerates implementation, not strategy

Works best with:
- Clear product specifications
- Timely human decisions
- Existing project structure (or willingness to define one)

---

## Common Workflows

### New Project from Scratch

```bash
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
claude
/agentful-product          # Interactive spec creation
/agentful-generate         # Generate agents
/agentful-start            # Begin development
/agentful-status           # Check progress
/agentful-decide           # Answer blocking decisions
```

### Existing Codebase

```bash
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
claude
/agentful-product          # Reverse-engineer spec
/agentful-generate         # Generate from existing code
/agentful-start            # Continue development
```

### Ad-hoc Questions

```bash
claude
/agentful "Should I use REST or GraphQL for this API?"
```
