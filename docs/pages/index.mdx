# agentful

**A structured development framework for Claude Code**

Build software with AI assistance that keeps you in control. Claude implements features, runs quality checks, and handles implementation details while you guide architectural decisions and maintain project direction.

**[Quick Start Guide →](/getting-started/quick-start)**

---

## Why agentful?

Modern software development faces a fundamental tension: AI can accelerate implementation dramatically, but development requires human judgment at critical decision points. As Anthropic's research on [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) notes:

> "The most successful implementations weren't using complex frameworks...they were building with simple, composable patterns."

agentful embraces this philosophy. Rather than attempting full autonomy, it structures AI-assisted development around **human-in-the-loop checkpoints** where Claude implements and you decide.

This approach addresses a core finding from Anthropic's [Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):

> "Claude performs best when it has a clear target to iterate against."

agentful provides that target through product specifications, quality gates, and specialized agents that work within defined scopes.

---

## What is agentful?

agentful is a pre-configured development environment for [Claude Code](https://code.anthropic.com) that provides:

1. **A `.claude/` directory structure** with agents, commands, and skills
2. **Specialized agents** for orchestration, architecture, backend, frontend, testing, and review
3. **Portable skills** that package development expertise into reusable patterns
4. **Quality gates** that adapt to your technology stack
5. **Human checkpoints** at key decision points

### Built on Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://code.anthropic.com) is Anthropic's official CLI tool that enables conversational AI assistance for software development. It provides core capabilities like file operations, command execution, and context management.

agentful extends Claude Code by adding:
- **Agent specialization** through dedicated instruction sets
- **Structured workflows** via commands that orchestrate multi-step processes
- **Portable expertise** packaged as reusable skills
- **State management** for tracking progress and decisions

### What is an Agent?

In agentful's architecture, an agent is Claude Code equipped with specialized instructions for a specific domain. When you invoke `@backend`, Claude receives the backend agent's instructions and operates within that scope.

This differs from multi-model agent frameworks. agentful uses a single Claude model with multiple instruction sets rather than multiple AI instances.

### What are Skills?

Skills are Claude Code's mechanism for packaging expertise into composable resources. From Anthropic's [Agent Skills](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/equipping-agents-for-the-real-world-with-agent-skills) documentation:

> "Skills extend Claude's capabilities by packaging your expertise into composable resources."

In agentful, skills provide:
- **Product tracking** for managing feature implementation state
- **Validation** for running quality checks adapted to your stack
- **Conversation management** for maintaining context across sessions
- **Architecture detection** for identifying technology patterns

---

## Philosophy

### Human-in-the-Loop by Design

agentful is **not** a fully autonomous coding system. It operates on these principles:

1. **You define what to build** - Claude doesn't decide product direction
2. **Claude implements** - Handles coding, testing, and iteration details
3. **You decide at checkpoints** - Architecture choices, library selection, security decisions
4. **Quality is verified** - Automated gates ensure implementation meets standards
5. **Progress is transparent** - Always know what's done, what's next, what needs decisions

This model works because it aligns with how effective AI-assisted development actually functions in practice.

### Composable, Not Complex

The framework avoids orchestration complexity in favor of simple, composable patterns:

- **Single model** - One Claude instance with different instruction contexts
- **Clear boundaries** - Each agent has explicit scope and responsibilities
- **Portable skills** - Reusable patterns that transfer between projects
- **Standard tools** - Built on Claude Code's native capabilities

### Progressive Disclosure

agentful introduces concepts gradually:

1. **Start simple** - Initialize, define product, begin building
2. **Discover capabilities** - Learn commands as you need them
3. **Customize gradually** - Adjust agents and workflows over time
4. **Scale complexity** - Framework adapts to project size

---

## How It Works

### Three-Tier Agent Architecture

agentful organizes agents into three tiers based on their lifecycle and scope:

#### Core Agents (Persistent)

These agents are fundamental to the framework and exist in every project:

- **Orchestrator** - Coordinates work across agents, never codes directly
- **Architect** - Analyzes tech stack, generates domain-specific agents
- **Product Analyzer** - Validates requirements for completeness and clarity

#### Domain Agents (Generated)

Created by the Architect based on your technology stack:

- **Backend** - Services, APIs, data access, business logic
- **Frontend** - UI components, state management, user interactions
- **Tester** - Test generation, test execution, coverage analysis
- **Reviewer** - Code review, quality validation, dead code detection
- **Fixer** - Automated remediation of validation failures

#### Ephemeral Agents (One-off)

Generated for specific tasks and discarded afterward:
- Database migration specialists
- API integration experts
- Performance optimization agents
- Security audit agents

This architecture reflects Anthropic's finding on [Multi-Agent Systems](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system):

> "A multi-agent system with Claude Opus 4 as the lead agent and Claude Sonnet 4 subagents outperformed single-agent Claude Opus 4 by 90.2%."

While agentful uses a single model, the specialized instruction sets create similar benefits through focused context and clear scope boundaries.

## Core Features

### 1. Adaptive Technology Detection

agentful automatically identifies your project's technology stack and generates appropriate domain agents. No configuration required - it detects:

- Programming languages and frameworks
- Testing tools and test runners
- Linters and type checkers
- Build systems and bundlers
- Database systems and ORMs

The Architect agent analyzes your codebase and creates specialized agents that understand your specific stack.

### 2. Reverse-Engineering Product Specifications

For existing codebases without documentation, agentful can generate comprehensive product specifications by analyzing:

- File and directory structure
- Code patterns and architectural decisions
- Feature implementations
- API endpoints and data models
- UI components and user flows

This provides a foundation for continued AI-assisted development on legacy or inherited projects.

### 3. Quality Gates

All implementations must pass validation before completion:

- **Tests passing** - All test suites execute successfully
- **No type errors** - Type checking passes (adapts to TypeScript, Python types, etc.)
- **No lint errors** - Code style and quality standards met
- **Coverage threshold** - Minimum 80% code coverage
- **No dead code** - Unused exports, files, and dependencies identified
- **No security issues** - Basic security validation

Gates adapt to your technology stack - the framework detects available tools and runs appropriate checks.

### 4. Structured Decision Management

When Claude encounters decisions requiring human judgment, it:

1. Documents the decision point with context
2. Pauses implementation
3. Saves state for resume
4. Waits for your guidance via `/agentful-decide`

This prevents Claude from making assumptions about architectural choices, library selection, or security configurations.

### 5. Progressive Development Loop

Implementation follows an iterative cycle:

1. **Plan** - Orchestrator identifies next task from product spec
2. **Implement** - Domain agents write code
3. **Test** - Tester creates and runs tests
4. **Validate** - Reviewer runs quality gates
5. **Fix** - Fixer remediates failures automatically
6. **Checkpoint** - Pause for human decisions if needed
7. **Update** - Progress tracked, repeat until complete

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **[Claude Code](https://code.anthropic.com)** - Anthropic's official CLI
- **Node.js 22+** - Required for the agentful CLI tool

### Three-Step Installation

#### 1. Initialize in Your Project

```bash
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
```

This creates the `.claude/` directory structure with agents, commands, and skills.

#### 2. Define Your Product

Choose the approach that fits your situation:

**For new projects:**
```bash
claude
/agentful-product
```

Answer guided questions about your product vision, features, and technical requirements. agentful creates a structured `PRODUCT.md` specification.

**For existing codebases:**
```bash
claude
/agentful-product
```

agentful scans your codebase, identifies domains and features, and generates documentation from your implementation.

**Manual specification:**

Edit `PRODUCT.md` directly:
```markdown
## Overview
Task management system for distributed teams.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14 + TypeScript
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest + Playwright

## Features
1. Authentication (CRITICAL)
2. Project management (HIGH)
3. Task assignment (MEDIUM)
```

#### 3. Start Development

```bash
/agentful-start
```

The Orchestrator analyzes your specification, the Architect detects your stack and generates domain agents, and implementation begins with human checkpoints for decisions.

## Extended Development Sessions

For longer development sessions with minimal interruption, use the [Ralph Wiggum plugin](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/plugins/ralph-wiggum) inside Claude Code:

```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Install the plugin (inside Claude Code)
/plugin install ralph-wiggum@anthropics

# Run extended development loop
/ralph-loop "/agentful-start" --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "AGENTFUL_COMPLETE"
```

Development continues automatically until:
- All features complete (100%)
- All quality gates pass
- Human decision required
- Maximum iterations reached

---

## What agentful Is NOT

To set appropriate expectations:

- **Not fully autonomous** - Requires human guidance at decision points
- **Not a replacement for developers** - Accelerates implementation, doesn't replace judgment
- **Not framework-agnostic** - Works best with common technology stacks
- **Not a testing framework** - Generates tests but requires test infrastructure
- **Not a deployment system** - Focuses on development, not operations

agentful excels at accelerating implementation within human-defined boundaries. It works best when you provide clear product specifications and make timely decisions at checkpoints.

---

## Common Workflows

### New Project

```bash
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init
claude
/agentful-product          # Interactive specification
/agentful-start            # Begin implementation
