Agentful is an opinionated starter template for Claude Code that transforms it into an autonomous development system with specialized agents, 24/7 development loops, dynamic tech stack detection, and quality gates.

## What is Agentful?

Agentful supercharges Claude Code with:

- **7 Specialized Agents** - Orchestrator, Architect, Backend, Frontend, Tester, Reviewer, Fixer
- **24/7 Development** - Works while you sleep with Ralph Wiggum loops
- **Dynamic Tech Stack Detection** - Automatically generates agents for YOUR stack
- **Quality Gates** - Type checking, Linting, Tests, Coverage, Security, Dead code detection
- **Progress Tracking** - See exactly what's done and what's next

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Initialize in your project
npx @itz4blitz/agentful init

# 2. Edit PRODUCT.md with your requirements

# 3. Start Claude Code
claude

# 4. Begin autonomous development
/agentful-start
```

That's it! Agentful will analyze your product spec, detect your tech stack, generate specialized agents, and start building autonomously.

    A[Initialize] --> B[Define Product]

    A --> A1["npx agentful init"]
    B --> B1["Edit PRODUCT.md"]
    C --> C1["/agentful-start"]

    B1 --> B2["Your specs + tech stack"]
    C1 --> C2["Autonomous development"]
    C2 --> C3["24/7 Ralph Wiggum loops"]
    C3 --> C4["100% complete"]
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/agentful-start` | Begin or resume autonomous development |
| `/agentful-status` | Check current progress and what's being worked on |
| `/agentful-decide` | Answer pending decisions that block development |
| `/agentful-validate` | Run all quality checks |

---

## Agents

Agentful includes specialized agents that work together:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `orchestrator` | The brain - coordinates work, never codes directly |
| `architect` | Analyzes tech stack, generates specialized agents dynamically |
| `backend` | Services, repositories, controllers, APIs |
| `frontend` | Components, pages, hooks, styling |
| `tester` | Unit, integration, E2E tests |
| `reviewer` | Code review, dead code detection, quality validation |
| `fixer` | Auto-fixes validation failures |

---

## 24/7 Development

For fully autonomous overnight development, use the Ralph Wiggum plugin:

```bash
/ralph-loop "/agentful-start" --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "AGENTFUL_COMPLETE"
```

Agentful will work while you sleep, only stopping when:
- All features are complete (100%)
- All quality gates pass
- Or max iterations reached

---

## Quality Gates

Code must pass ALL gates before completion:

- All tests passing
- No TypeScript errors
- No lint errors
- No dead code (unused exports, files, dependencies)
- Test coverage ≥ 80%
- No security issues

---

## Project Structure

After initialization, your project will have:

```
your-project/
├── PRODUCT.md              # Edit this: your product spec
├── CLAUDE.md               # Project instructions for Claude

## Requirements

- **Claude Code** - [Install here](https://code.anthropic.com)
- **Node.js 22+**

### Optional: 24/7 Autonomous Development

For fully autonomous overnight development, install the Ralph Wiggum plugin inside Claude Code:

```bash
# 1. Start Claude Code in your project
claude

# 2. Inside Claude Code, install the plugin
/plugin install ralph-wiggum@anthropics

# 3. Then run autonomous loops
/ralph-loop "/agentful-start" --max-iterations 50 --completion-promise "AGENTFUL_COMPLETE"
```
